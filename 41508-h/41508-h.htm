<h2 class="p6">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_III" id="Page_III">iii</a></span></p>

<p>I was early aboard the fastest ship that ever foamed the seas.
Later, a long, strong whistle blast blew&mdash;the signal for starting&mdash;and
soon she headed southward, the great vessel traveling
through New York harbor to Sandy Hook as noiselessly as a
bobsleigh drawn through two feet of unpacked snow.</p>

<p>I had secured a second class ticket to Buenos Aires, Argentina,
by way of England, this marking the first of several legs
of the world over which I had planned to travel. Thirteen
hundred and fifty dollars, representing years of economical living,
was the sum deemed as necessary to accomplish what I had
purposed doing. By trade I am a printer and linotype operator.</p>

<p>In earlier years money for traveling expenses was of little
concern, for the fascination that accompanies prowling about
freight trains seeking an empty box car, or the open end door
of a loaded one in which to steal a ride, or of turning one's back
to the tender of a locomotive to protect the eyes from hot cinders
coming from a snorting passenger engine while standing on
the draughty platform of a "blind" baggage car&mdash;one without
end doors&mdash;the train at the same time traveling at a speed of
from 45 to 50 miles an hour&mdash;the "cinder days" during the
catch-as-catch-can periods of traveling through coastwise tracts
of country, across unbroken prairie stretches and over mountain
fastnesses, are pleasant ones to recall, not forgetting the hungry,
cold and wet spells that all men meet with who are enticed
by the gritty allurements to beat their way about the country on
railroad trains.</p>

<p>Since Benjamin Franklin's day it has been a custom with
printers to travel from place to place, and, as some of the devotees
of the "art preservative of all arts" had covered large
territories of the world from time to time, I wished to be numbered
among those at the top of the list. A union printer has
little trouble in getting work in the United States, by reason
of the large Sunday newspaper editions requiring extra men
during the latter part of the week, and by vacancies taking place
through the "moving spirit" of the workers, which has always
characterized the printing trade.</p>

<p>This fascination, however, like other diversions of a rough
nature, lost its charm in time, as it proved more comfortable
traveling by passenger trains&mdash;inside the coach and sitting on
a cushioned seat&mdash;than riding on the platform of a car that
was being constantly pelted with red-hot cinders. I had graduated
from the "free-ride" school.</p>

<p>On a trip through North America I had visited Yosemite
Valley and Mariposa Big Tree Grove, Yellowstone Park, the
Grand Canyon of Arizona, Mexico, Mammoth Cave, Niagara
Falls, and the Thousand Islands after I had enrolled in the
"Cushion College."</p>

<p>Later on, having saved $400, a trip to Europe was made,
visiting in that part of the world most of the chief points of
interest. I had gone as far East as Vienna, Austria, when my
funds became so low that two meals a day was all they would
allow of, and I resorted to traveling at night on railroad trains
with one compulsory aim in view&mdash;to save lodging money.
After I had bought my steamship ticket in Rome, Italy, for
New York, two weeks before the ship was to sail from Naples,
the best I could figure out of the surplus money I would have
at the time of sailing&mdash;on a two meals a day basis&mdash;was four
francs&mdash;eighty cents. My savings for years, in short, had
passed over the office counters of railroad and steamship companies.</p>

<p>As the major portion of my travel was by water, the nautical
word Leg has been chosen as a designating term for the different
sections of the world visited, embracing South American
cities, South Africa, Zululand, and Victoria Falls, in Rhodesia;
Australia, New Zealand and principal South Sea Island groups;
then back to Africa and up the East Coast to Zanzibar and
Mombasa; next through British East Africa to and across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_V" id="Page_V">v</a></span>
Victoria Nyanza into Uganda. Leaving Africa, we sailed over
the Indian Ocean to India, visiting, among other features in
that country, the Himalaya Mountains, and afterwards Ceylon.
From Colombo we traveled eastward to the Straits Settlements,
Philippines, China and Japan, concluding observations
at the Hawaiian Islands. The journey was from New York
to New York over the territory briefly outlined in the foregoing
itinerary.</p>

<p>From Sandy Hook we sail for England.</p>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER I</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>A puzzling phase of ocean travel soon becomes apparent
during a passenger ship's journey to one making his first voyage&mdash;sometimes
when a vessel has been at sea not more than a few
hours. He is apt to find himself at a loss to account for the
absence of the many persons who crowded the deck rails of
the steamship&mdash;chatting, saying good-by to friends and some
bidding a final farewell to their country&mdash;before and immediately
after the vessel pulled away from her dock into the
harbor. After a few days, however, the mystery gradually unfolds.
Vacant chairs in the dining saloon become occupied
from time to time as the journey advances; more passengers are
taking part in deck amusements; new faces are seen in the social
hall and smoking saloon&mdash;the ship's "family" surely grows.
On voyages of from two to four weeks' duration this feature
becomes even more interesting. Frequently, when the ship
has reached the end of the journey, before which every one
would seem to have become used to the sea, "strangers" will
be observed leaving the vessel. One cannot help thinking the
ship has stopped during the night hours and taken on passengers
from the main. This is explained by some voyagers keeping
to their cabins from the time of sailing.</p>

<p>Seasickness is largely responsible for this perplexing phase
of water travel. Women are more affected than men, and the
man who will discover a remedy for seasickness will find his
name immortalized. Many women will travel for weeks on
the water so sick they cannot raise their heads, yet not a complaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
word will be uttered by most of them. This form of
bravery seems to be the only comforting thing that accompanies
the sea wreaking out its vengeance on womankind.</p>

<p>Six days after leaving Sandy Hook found us in Liverpool,
England. Passengers disembarked early in the forenoon, who,
having heard so much of England's dull atmosphere, were all
surprised to find the sun shining. The orb was of a vapory
appearance, though, which suggested that perhaps it had been
on a sea voyage also, as there was a marked resemblance between
the appearance of the sun and some of the passengers
who had undergone a sick trip across. Most of us boarded a
train for London.</p>

<p>Railway train service in England is fast, the speed on main
lines being from 45 to 50 miles an hour. The passenger
coaches are of compartment design, which are comfortable to
ride in when only half filled, or four persons to a compartment;
but when from six to eight passengers&mdash;the latter number
being the full seating capacity&mdash;occupy one compartment,
travel proves very uncomfortable, as there is no room to stretch
one's legs in any direction, since the passengers sitting on one
side face those seated on the other side. It is a case of knees
to knees. Railroad fare is two and three cents a mile; a
higher rate is charged for hauling freight in England than that
prevailing in America. Food, however, is cheaper than on
American trains.</p>

<p>The locomotives are small&mdash;some of them not half the tonnage
of the American engine&mdash;but the driving wheels reach
to the top of the boiler, which accounts for the high speed
schedules of the English railroads. One misses the ringing of
the locomotive bell, as there are no bells on English engines.
Another feature of the English railroads that seems odd to an
American is the small freight cars, which in some instances are
not one-third as large as some of the American cars and trucks.
Trains in England have not the solid appearance of the American
train, for the reason that their wheels are not like the
American wheel, but have spokes, like those of a wheelbarrow.
The convenience a union railway station affords the traveling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
public, found in many cities of America, is much missed when
visiting the metropolis of England. Naturally, numerous railways
center in London, and the terminus of each seems to have
been located as widely apart from each other as the boundaries
of the city will allow. None of the stations seen here can
favorably compare with those found in the larger cities of the
United States.</p>

<p>The cleanliness of London's streets is the first impression
one has of the premier city of Europe. And how obliging the
public conveyance employees are; and the policemen, also. It is
a pleasure to go about in London, as every one seems willing
to answer questions, to point out to a stranger places of interest,
and to make one comfortable in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>"London traffic," a feature of this city one often hears mentioned,
is accounted for, to a large degree, by the absence of
surface car lines or elevated railroads coursing the streets of
London City proper, and also to the narrowness of many of
the main thoroughfares. With such an immense population,
one can infer the great demand placed upon 'buses, public
hacks, taxicabs and private vehicles, which at once suggests
light-tire traffic. Heavy trucks, loaded with all sorts of merchandise,
are not seen in corresponding sections of London as
one finds them in populous American centers. In the subways,
or tubes, are but two tracks, which prohibit, of course,
fast travel. On the other hand, sixteen underground railways
intersect the city and suburbs. The atmosphere of a
subway is perhaps a more cosmopolitan phase than any other of
our industrial factors. Were a blind person&mdash;one familiar
with our underground railway odors&mdash;to sail from New York
for Europe, being ignorant of the presence of subways there,
and later, in London or Paris, find himself at the entrance of
a "tube," he would at once know he was at the approach of
a subway by the presence of the smell, as a similar atmosphere
emanates from all of them.</p>

<p>Street car fare is higher for long distances than in most
American cities. Though short distance rides are cheaper,
some of the five cent rides in America would cost fifteen cents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in London. Motor 'buses, which are numerous, go a certain
distance for two cents, but the next "stage" is another two-cent
charge, and by the time eight or ten miles are traveled one
will have paid from 10 to 15 cents. Most public conveyances
are double decked. Electric trolley cars are operated outside
of London City proper, and the fare on these is similar to that
charged by the 'buses. One can ride a long distance in a cab
for 25 cents, however.</p>

<p>Newspapers here generally have not the attractive nor the
prosperous appearance of those in the United States. Until
recently most of the London dailies sold for two cents, and even
more. Periodicals and books also are more expensive in Great
Britain, although the average wages paid artisans in this industry
is about half those paid in America. Mechanics engaged
in other trades received from $11 to $15 weekly, and
consequently the British mechanic in America doubles the salary
of his own country, plus other advantages. House rent, generally
paid weekly, runs from $3.50 to $5. Most of the working
people of London live in the suburbs, and are charged but
half price&mdash;about 8 cents&mdash;for return railway tickets if
bought for trains reaching the city before 8 o'clock in the morning.
The government collects an income tax on all yearly
salaries of $600 and over.</p>

<p>It looks strange to American visitors in London to see only
boys engaged in keeping the streets clean. One may not quite
agree with the practice of boys doing that sort of work&mdash;for
the reason it looks as if men should be engaged at such employment&mdash;but
the fact remains the streets are very clean. The
sweepings are not put in cans, as is customary in some American
cities, where they might be tipped over by mischievous boys,
but iron bins are placed in the sidewalk close to the curb, into
which the refuse is emptied. This custom seems much better
than the American system.</p>

<p>Seen drawn about the streets here, close to the curb, is what
one would call a street sprinkler. It is a sprinkler, but the
liquid running from the pipes is a disinfectant, a carbolic acid
odor being noticeable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The sale of matches by persons who seem to be in needy
circumstances, seen at almost every corner of the business sections
of the city, leads one to think that they must be used even
for stove fuel. The proportion of poorly dressed people is
much larger than in American cities. Any of the homeless who
apply for shelter are provided with sleeping accommodation by
the authorities.</p>

<p>The price of food in a similar class of restaurants seemed
more expensive in London than in New York. At a second
class hotel where I stopped the rate was $1.25 for room and
breakfast, but heat was not included. A fireplace in the room
contained smoky, bituminous coal, and to have this lighted cost
25 cents. So with the room, fire and breakfast, the charge
came to $1.50 a day.</p>

<p>Chairs are scattered about the London parks, and an American
naturally thinks seats in public places are free, as in the
United States; but one is not sitting long before a man appears
and asks for a "check." The person resting then learns that
it costs two cents to occupy a chair in these places. The
benches, however, are free, but these are few compared to the
number found in American parks. Similar conditions will be
met with in some of the parks of Berlin, and also in Paris, but
the resting places in the French capital are more liberally supplied
with free seats.</p>

<p>Many men may be seen in London wearing a "plug" hat,
a sack coat and trousers turned up to the ankles. Those engaged
at clerical employment usually wear this sort of headgear
to the office. Mechanics, also, boast of a "stove-pipe"
in their wardrobes. While the high hat may be retained by
some artisans as a memento of their wedding day, still many
may be seen worn by this class of breadwinner when attending
church services.</p>

<p>No people spend less time in public eating and drinking
places than Americans. In Continental Europe they have their
cafés, chairs and tables inside the buildings and out on the
sidewalks and streets, and these are used to a large extent as
offices by patrons, as proprietors furnish writing paper and ink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to customers. In England they have their tea rooms, where
men sit and sip tea and smoke their pipes for hours. Cake or
scones are usually served with tea, an additional charge being
made.</p>

<p>To no people more than Americans have so many heirlooms
of memory been handed down by England. How the serious
thought of one is aroused by a visit to Westminster Abbey or
St. Paul's Cathedral; how youthful days stand before one, so
to speak, when a visit is made to London Bridge, Hyde Park,
the Tower, the great British Museum, or to historic places in
and about the city where great Englishmen lived and died.</p>

<p>Hearing so much of the English Parliament building,
one is led to believe that he will see the best legislative
structure in the world when his eyes rest on this historical
edifice. He may see in his mind's eye an imposing structure of
white marble or granite built on an elevated plot of land, as
most capitols are, rich with ornamentation and strikingly imposing.
But, on the contrary, the building, located on the
River Thames, is rather mediæval in appearance. America is
far behind some of the European countries in art galleries, good
roads, docks, and splendid cathedrals, but there are features of
the United States which neither Europe nor other divisions
of the world can equal. For instance, no capitol can compare
with the admirable appearance of the United States'
legislative building; in no country will one find such splendid
municipal parks as are found in some American cities. We
have not seen Hagenbeck's Zoo in Hamburg, Germany, but,
apart from that city, Bronx Zoo in New York is foremost of
those seen in other cities; the Museum of Natural History in
Gotham is unexcelled; our great bridges are unequaled; the
interior of the Congressional Library in Washington, D. C.,
will stand comparison with any, and the inspiring Washington
Monument, also located in the national capital, stands alone
when dealing with campaniles, towers, and pagodas. To the
foregoing "prides" of the new world may be added towering
Mariposa Big Tree Grove, peerless Yosemite Valley, wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Yellowstone Park and the marvelous Grand Canyon of
Arizona.</p>

<p>After a short stay in London we boarded a "boat train"&mdash;an
English travel convenience&mdash;for Southampton, from
which port the steamship on which we had booked passage
sailed for South America.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the Bay of Biscay a storm was encountered, the
decks being vacated by passengers and the cabin berths made
use of for some time. During the night sounds were heard
at intervals that reminded one of a large tree falling. The
piano in the social hall had been forced loose from its fastening
by the rolling and pitching of the ship, and while in what might
be termed its periods of tantrum the big musical instrument
seemed bent on smashing all the furniture "in the house."
Most of the passengers were awake, and a great many were
inquiring if the ship was breaking to pieces.</p>

<p>Those starting on long journeys should provide themselves
with a passport. One may travel for years through certain
sections of the world and not be called upon to show his national
voucher to verify his identity; yet it is a good thing to
have one in one's possession. One may be taken into custody
in some foreign city through mistaken identity, or be detained
in other ways, when a passport would clear matters at once
with small inconvenience and little delay, compared to much
uneasiness and considerable time lost, if one has neglected to
include in his traveling outfit this means of identification.
Again, when visiting a consulate, one will not have conversed
with the officials long before he will be asked, directly or indirectly,
if he has his passport with him. If the visitor should
not have one, the conversation is usually of a casual nature.
On the other hand, if the visitor has his government's credentials,
an interesting chat will often result, during which information
may be gathered of the character of the country he
is traveling in that would not be volunteered to an American
who had failed to identify himself with the standard voucher.
When leaving the consulate, the person with a passport is generally
invited to "call any time while in the city." Furthermore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
if the assistance of a consul were needed in any contingency,
that government officer, if he should not care to offer
a helping hand, may evade a reasonable duty, and defend his
actions behind the fact that the "alleged" American did not
have a passport. If the person in need of official assistance
had this means of identification, that same officer, fearing he
would be later called upon by his government to explain why
he neglected to do his duty, would exert himself and lend aid
to his countryman. An American with a passport in foreign
lands has a better standing with his government's representatives
than a citizen who has not provided himself with one.</p>

<p>Being good for only two years, and not generally recognized
after that time, in order to keep in good standing with his
country, one must, if living in foreign parts, have his passport
renewed or extended. Only in exceptional circumstances is a
consul allowed to issue passports; these must come from Washington.
A consul may extend one, however, for an additional
two years; but the passport cannot be extended more than once.
Application should be made to the Secretary of State, Washington,
D. C., when two blanks&mdash;native and naturalized&mdash;will
be sent to the applicant. If a native, he fills out the native
blank and will have the contents sworn to before a notary
public. The verified blank will then be sent to the Secretary
of State, when a passport will soon reach the applicant. The
charge is one dollar, plus the notary's fee.</p>

<p>"I wish I had one of those fat, juicy beefsteaks that I was
served with while traveling across America," said a Portuguese
woman globe-trotter, as some of us, like chickens after rain,
began to appear on deck when the storm had subsided. "I
never ate beefsteak in any country that tasted as good as those
I got in America," she added, with a perceptible smacking of
her lips. She wasn't the only one who wished they had a
succulent piece of American beefsteak. But the commissary of
the ship had little to do while traveling from Cape Ushant to
Cape Finistierre&mdash;the former marking the north and the latter
the south boundaries of the Bay of Biscay, 365 miles across.</p>

<p>At Lisbon, Portugal, the chilling winds of the north and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
raw weather were succeeded by soft, south breezes and warm
sunshine. Entering the Tagus River on our way to the Portuguese
capital, we passed a commanding fort, the banks green
with grass and vegetables. Reaching the city, women in their
bare feet and none too tidy, bearing heavy burdens on their
heads, mostly in baskets&mdash;fish, vegetables, coal, flowers, and
other marketable commodities&mdash;revealed a condition in Southern
Europe not pleasant to contemplate, and which is seen in
few countries of Continental Europe. The first suggestion of
the tropics was had at Lisbon, by reason of a great many of the
people, dark skinned, appearing in thin clothing and bare feet.
Verdure was growing on every side&mdash;it was the month of
February.</p>

<p>Travelers cannot fail to show a slight weakness for the
small Latin country, for Portugal was the home of Vasco da
Gama, the explorer&mdash;a really great traveler&mdash;whose daring
achievements late in the fifteenth century laid the foundation
of an empire, and who discovered places and countries we are to
visit later.</p>

<p>"Look!" said a man wearing the cloth of a church official,
who was showing a number of visitors around a Lisbon cathedral.
We were in the crypt, where, in expensive coffins,
rested the remains of some of the distinguished dead of Portugal.
He had opened the lid of a casket and invited his visitors
to look inside. To our astonishment, in the gruesome light,
our eyes rested on the crumbling remains of a personage who,
the official said, had passed away a long time before. More
coffin lids were turned back, and in the boxes were seen, in the
murky light, the grim, long outline of a human being. We
had never known any one to go so far to obtain a fee.</p>

<p>American-made street cars are in use in the Portuguese
capital, and were easily recognized from those manufactured
in other countries, as the American car is single, while those of
other countries are mostly of a double-decked pattern.</p>

<p>Pavement of dark gray and white colored stone in that city
looks odd, laid at twisting angles. A plaza is paved entirely
with this deceptive stone, which sailors call "Rolling Motion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Square." This square is located close to the wharf, and sailors,
having finished their shore leave and returning to their
ship, usually find trouble in getting off "Rolling Motion
Square."</p>

<p>Egg soup is a delicacy made in Lisbon. When served, it
resembles consommé, with halves of a hard-boiled egg swimming
in the dish.</p>

<p>The business section of Lisbon is built between two high
hills, which necessitates using an elevator, in some instances, if
one is going from the center to the higher part of the city. The
buildings are of stone and brick, faced with cement. One of
the most attractive avenues in the world runs through the commercial
district of the city. This boulevard is unusually wide,
the center comprising a broad park place, with roadways of a
good width on each side. Nearly half a million people compose
the population of this Latin capital. Portugal was a
Roman province as early as 200 B. C.</p>

<p>Funchal, Madeira Island, located about 450 miles west of
the Moroccan coast, was next reached, being favored with a
good sea from Lisbon, the first since leaving Southampton.
This place, with a population of 20,000, is the chief port of
Madeira, and its attractiveness&mdash;flowers, vines, spreading
trees, climate and tidy appearance&mdash;proves a magnet to many
Europeans who seek rest and recreation.</p>

<p>A strange and unusual public "hack" here arrests one's
attention. This vehicle, covered with canvas and drawn by
oxen, is really a sleigh, although it is doubtful if a flake of snow
has ever fallen in this section. The runners, as those of a
snow sled, are shod with strips of steel, which are pulled over
streets paved with cobblestone. When ready to start, the
driver says a word to the oxen, and off they go, the sleigh gliding
over the paving nearly as smoothly as if drawn over snow.
The steel runners, passing over them for years, have worn the
stones quite smooth, even slippery in some instances, hence the
practicability of the sleigh-hack.</p>

<p>Madeira Island, termed the Pearl of the Atlantic, a Portuguese
possession, has an area of 315 square miles, and is 35
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
miles long and 12 wide. It is very productive of fruit&mdash;oranges,
lemons, figs, pomegranates, pears, peaches and grapes.
The island is more noted for its good climate and wines, however,
most of the inhabitants being engaged in the grape growing
industry. The United States came to the fore in 1871 by
saving the grapevines here, which were being destroyed by a
pest. The American grapevine stock was introduced and
grafted to the native stump, which withstood the attacks of
phyloxera.</p>

<p>Funchal is a sea junction, as most of the passenger steamships
plying between Europe and South American ports stop
at this place. Passengers coming north from South America
and going to South Africa come to Madeira, and those coming
from South Africa and going to South America also transship
at this island.</p>

<p>Getting a glimpse of the places mentioned in the foregoing
will account for one traveling from the United States to South
America by way of England. The fare was also cheaper for
the same accommodation than by going direct from New York.</p>

<p>We regretfully return to our ship, there being no more stops
for eight days, as we are to recross the Atlantic Ocean diagonally.
The big vessel, with a crowded passenger list and
loaded to the water line with cargo, was headed toward the
equatorial line, sailing on a velvety sea. Sailors were busy
stretching canvas over the decks to make the hot weather soon
to be encountered more bearable, while the electric fans in the
cabins were being put in order. Every one had settled down
for the sail to Pernambuco, Brazil, the next port.</p>

<p>During the trip British third-class passengers enjoyed the
benefits of the good maritime laws of their country, while passengers
from other countries traveling in the same section of
the ship did not fare so well. Britishers were allowed privileges
on a portion of the upper deck, as provided by law, while
third-class passengers who embarked at ports south of Southampton
remained on the third-class deck.</p>

<p>It is surprising how time slips by during long voyages, and
it is interesting to note the national grouping of travelers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
French passengers will be found assembled on a certain portion
of the deck, the Spaniards likewise, also Germans&mdash;each nationality
generally keeping to itself. Our breakfast was ready
at 8 o'clock, and a light lunch served two and a half hours
later. Ship inspection usually takes place at from 10 to 11
o'clock in the forenoon, the captain, the purser, the doctor or
the chief steward being the officers who form this committee.
Each deck is visited, when the dining saloons, kitchens, berths,
bedding and other furnishings of the cabins generally receive
the critical attention of the inspectors. Passengers having complaints
to make or suggestions to offer concerning ship conditions
may do so at this time. At half-past twelve dinner was
ready. In the second class section mealtimes are designated
as breakfast, dinner and supper; in the first-class, breakfast,
luncheon and dinner. When ready, these are generally announced
by ringing a bell, beating a gong, or by bugle call.
Many passengers take a nap in their cabins after dinner, and,
if not in the cabin, one is pretty sure to find them in the Land
of Nod in their steamer chair on deck; others read a great deal
and divide the time with sleep. The sleepers are sometimes
hurriedly awakened from their slumbers, however, as what is
termed "fire practice" takes place several times a week on well-conducted
ships. Bells clang, without warning; the ship's
whistle blows shrill blasts; sailors, stewards and officers hurry
to the lifeboats to which they had been assigned before sailing,
which are soon raised from their davits, swung outward, and
lowered at the sides of the vessel; members of the crew may be
seen wearing life-saving devices, and the passengers generally
give evidence of anxious concern on such occasions until they
learn it is but a "fire drill" that is being enacted instead of the
ship being really afire. Beef tea was served in the cool climate
and ices when the hot zones were reached between noontime
and supper. Light lunch&mdash;generally cheese and crackers and
tea&mdash;was served between the evening meal and bedtime.
Music was furnished twice a day by an orchestra. Religious
services&mdash;those of the Church of England&mdash;on British passenger
steamships are made obligatory by maritime law. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Sunday mornings many of the passengers attended, which took
place in the social hall of the first-class section, the ritual being
read by the captain or purser. Most of the ship's crew must
be present, some of whom generally lead the singing and furnish
the music. It often happens, however, preachers are among
the travelers, when one of them will be invited to preach.
First class passengers are expected to appear in evening dress
for dinner on vessels of some of the popular British lines running
to far Southern ports.</p>

<p>So far as bird life is concerned, the sea is a graveyard when
sailing through the equatorial zone. All fowl leave the ship
when the sun gets hot and the breezes become warm. The
only winged life appearing in this hot section of the sea was
flying fish, sometimes hundreds of them rising from the water
at the same time. These fish are from four to ten inches in
length, slender, and resemble young mackerel. They spring
from the sea by a quick stroke of the tail, and, with fins outspread,
are able to sustain and prolong their leap for a minute
or more. The fins measure several inches across and become
transparent in the sun, but do not flap like the wings of a bird.
As the fish rise only from six inches to a few feet from the
water, their flight, in a choppy or rough ocean, is generally not
more than from two to twenty feet, as they disappear on coming
in contact with a wave. On a calm sea, however, their isinglass-like
"wings" will often remain outstretched for a distance
of a hundred yards or so, when the fish will dart into the water
as suddenly as they emerged from it.</p>

<p>"Neptune" is a "game" played only at sea, and the "sport"
is generally indulged in when a passenger steamship is sailing
under the equator. A canvas tank is fixed on deck and
nearly filled with water. It is an unvarying rule with some
travelers that one who has not crossed the equator must be
"Neptuned." A "coaster," as one is termed who has never
crossed the equatorial line, is reminded by the Simon-pures
that, in order to be a full-fledged traveler, he must take a plunge
in the canvas tank. Most passengers who are not sick comply
with the request, but there are some who do not take kindly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the idea. In such instances a half dozen, or a dozen passengers
if necessary, bend the will of the unwilling one to their idea
of maintaining this tradition of the sea by literally picking up
the unbeliever and pitching him into the canvas tank of water.
He then has been "Neptuned." Danger of taking cold from
this outdoor plunge is slight, as often the tar in the cracks
between boards on deck of the ship is bubbling from the intense
rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Having reached the southern division of the world, the heavenly
bodies forming the Southern Cross appear. The cross is
not composed of a thickly starred upright beam, neither is there
a compact panel of stars forming the crosspiece. Four stars
located at certain sections of the heavens form a distinct outline
of a cross. The great crucifix at times appears to be standing
straight, but more often it will be seen in the heavens in a
reclining position, so to speak; again it will be observed resting
on its side, but never pointing downward. The section of the
sky in which the cross is to be found is the southeast. At one
season of the year it will rest near the center of the firmament
and in the "Milky Way "; at another period it will be seen
closer to the horizon. Lesser bodies appear in the zone
embraced by the four stars that compose the profile of the ensign
of Christianity, but these neither add to nor detract from the
formation of the solemn emblem of suffering that stands out so
clearly among the millions of orbs in the starry firmament.
Two bright stars below, in direct line with the bottom star of
the cross, are called "the pointers."</p>

<p>What a difference is at once apparent in the period of daylight
north of the equator and that south of the equatorial line.
From a slow setting sun and a lingering twilight north of the
great line to a rapidly setting sun and a comparatively short
twilight south of the equator is observed. Fifteen to twenty
minutes after the sun sets darkness will have settled.</p>

<p>"Holy stoning a ship" is a nautical term that, when first
heard by a landsman, arouses his curiosity concerning the particular
duty the phrase suggests in a sailor's routine. A holy
stone&mdash;somewhat larger than two bricks placed together, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
cream color and of a soft or sandy material&mdash;is used to whiten
the deck of a ship. Most persons would conclude that a thorough
washing of a deck with clear water should satisfy one
possessed of even super-neat exactions. But a sailor's conception
of the term "spick and span" does not end in this matter
with the merit of water alone. The holy stone is secured in
an iron frame similar to that of a house mop, with handle
attached. It is also pushed forward and pulled backward when
used to clean a deck in the same way that a mop is used to clean
a floor. The deck is made wet before "stoning," then
sprinkled with fine white sand, and is next thoroughly gone
over with the "cleaner." When the sailor has finished his
hard "scrubbing" task the deck appears many shades brighter
than it would if only water had been used. The term "holy
stone" is said to have originated through the first stones used in
bleaching ship decks having been taken from the ruined walls
of a church in Cornwall, England.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>Security of life in an Indian's bark canoe, even when going
over river rapids, would seem assured, compared to the chances
against one being able to keep his feet on a Brazilian catamaran
sailing on the broad ocean. Men stand on two logs tied
together, these about a foot each in diameter and from eight to
ten feet in length, the upper side flat, with a small pole fastened
in one of the logs, to which is secured a piece of canvas&mdash;as
flimsy a sample of sea craft as one may see in a lifetime. No
provision being made for a seat on the shaky and risky "boat"&mdash;no
room for one, in fact&mdash;it seemed dangerous to sail it
even on a small lake; yet a number of these were seen skimming
over the sea several miles outside the harbor of Pernambuco,
Brazil.</p>

<p>We had reached South America at the beginning of March,
which is Northern August south of the equator. The winter
season of the year in the northern is the summer in the southern
division of the world.</p>

<p>Passengers leaving the vessel entered a large basket by a door.
When six persons had got inside, the winches on the ship began
to revolve, raising the basket high enough to clear the deck rail,
and the passengers were slowly lowered to a lighter below.
Chug! They had reached the bottom, and if any of the travelers
had their tongue between their teeth at that moment it
would be safe to infer that that member had suffered from the
bump. This carrier was six feet deep, made of reed or wicker,
and was kept in shape and supported by circular iron bands, like
the hoops round a barrel, which, in this case, were inside the
basket. Passengers embark by the same means. Crude and
odd devices of this sort lend spice to travel.</p>

<p>Bahia, the oldest city in Brazil, was the next stop. At this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
port no basket was used for disembarking, passengers leaving
the ship by a side ladder and being taken ashore in launches.
An unusual number of men seemed to board the vessel, and
later, when the gong sounded for visitors to go ashore, most of
them left with their pockets bulging with goods bought aboard.
Pertaining to this, an amusing feature came to light&mdash;the custom
officers, who had been stationed at the gangway and other
parts of the ship to prevent smuggling, seemingly not noticing
the difference in the girth of a man on leaving the vessel to
that when he boarded her.</p>

<p>Sailing on the same smooth sea on which we had started from
Madeira Island ten days before, Rio de Janeiro, the capital and
metropolis of Brazil, was reached later.</p>

<p>The harbor of this city is considered the finest in the
world. The noted haven is entered by a deep channel, three-quarters
of a mile wide, flanked by two imposing stone
mountains, rising nearly 1,300 and 1,100 feet, respectively.
Tropical vegetation grows luxuriantly on the shores, and
beyond a circle of high, evergreen mountains offer an unusually
fascinating foreground. The harbor is sixteen miles long and
from two to seven miles wide, this area being dotted with over
a hundred islands, also heavily verdured with a tropical
growth. One feature, however, robs Rio de Janeiro and her
harbor of a scenic climax. To the left, on which side of the bay
the city stands, rise low hills, which shut from view, until
opposite the wharves, what otherwise would reveal a panorama
of the metropolis in keeping with that of the fame of the harbor.
One is at a loss to account for the absence of docks here, considering
this city has a population of nearly a million inhabitants
and is the commercial center of Brazil.</p>

<p>Before, and also after, the ship anchored in the bay, where a
large number of passengers left, the deafening noise made by
hack barkers and hotel runners, shouting from boats below,
exceeded anything of this nature heard elsewhere. Here it was
a medley of whistles on yachts, launches and similar craft,
together with blasts from horns, a racket from other noise-making
devices, and the raucous voices of fruit vendors, crying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
their wares from rowboats. For a quarter of a mile about the
vessel hundreds of small craft were bumping into each other,
their owners cursing and shouting at those in approaching boats
who sought a more advantageous place where a fare might come
their way; in no place in the world, one would feel safe in
saying, could there be more turmoil and confusion under similar
circumstances. No one seemed to be in charge; every one was
bending his every effort for a fare. Evidently a great deal of
revenue would be cut off from a considerable number of the
population of Rio were the government to build docks.</p>

<p>Having read of cholera in Rio years before would lead one
to entertain a belief that he is entering an unclean city, and the
great number of blacks and half-castes one sees before he gets
off the ship suggests nothing to the contrary. But, when in the
city proper, what a surprise one meets with. No place is better
supplied with small parks than this metropolis, and public conveniences
and sanitation in general, which are so essential to the
physical welfare of a people, are creditable features. To be
sure, the old part is of Spanish style&mdash;brick and cement houses,
with narrow streets. The object in building narrow streets is
to foil the sun&mdash;to keep cool&mdash;as the narrower they are the
more shade is cast. One will soon notice the difference in
comfort when walking between narrow or wide streets in hot
climates&mdash;the narrow, shady ones will be given the preference.
Only one vehicle can travel in a street, and for this reason
traffic passes through one and returns by another. They are
one-way streets. Two persons moving in opposite directions
can just manage to pass without one of them stepping off
the walk. Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in South
America, and good management of this tropical center was in
evidence.</p>

<p>Looking down Avenue Central, one of the principal thoroughfares,
composed largely of business buildings, a scene of
architectural beauty is revealed rivaling any metropolis in the
world. No street cars run on this avenue, but brightly painted,
well designed, small motor 'buses are in use. The artistic effect
reflected by the arrangement of lights and trees is in keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
in every detail with the admirable designs of the buildings on
each side. A municipal theater on this street, prominent by its
striking exterior ornamentation, together with handsome government
buildings, add greatly to the attractiveness of Avenue
Central. To an American the street view at the head not only
equals the lower portion, but is enhanced, for there stands the
Monroe Palace, a memorial to James Monroe, whose name is
immortalized as the father of the Monroe Doctrine, serving as
a fitting cap-sheaf, and at the same time infusing patriotic sentiment
to the harmonious foreground and attractive environments.
From Monroe Palace, which is shaded by trees growing
in a beautiful park at the side, Avenue Central verges into
a long boulevard, built alongside the walled harbor, fringed in
places with rows of palm trees, fifty to sixty feet high; under
tropical verdured hills, with parks, flowers and shade trees
bordering the thoroughfare to the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>This palm tree of Rio is the highest we have seen either of
nut-bearing or non-nut-bearing species. The trunks are smooth,
straight and round, free of limbs, and gradually taper to their
full height, where a circle of fronds branch broadly from every
side. Standing between these tropical, sentinel-like columns,
high above the spectator will be seen an arch formed of long,
broad leaves. As some of these double rows of palms extend
for considerable distances, this light-green archway grows more
enchanting as, down the pillared vista, the fringed-frond arcade
gradually lowers and contracts until the trees converge into a
narrow bower. The symmetrical finish to the towering palms
of Rio will remain in one's mind long after other of Nature's
masterpieces, of equal merit but differing in form, will have
been forgotten.</p>

<p>American money and enterprise have added much to the modern
public utilities of Rio, for the street car and lighting systems
are headed by Americans. "Bond" is the name for street cars
here. To raise capital to construct the system bonds were
issued, and as the word bond was much used before construction
began, the Brazilians, when the cars started running, called
them "bonds."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>The Portuguese language is used in the Brazilian republic.
But what a mixed population these Brazilians are! Most of
them are dark-skinned and the greater number are black.
From observation, there seems to be little or no distinction
between the races. Yet this race possesses a knowledge rarely
displayed by others in erecting buildings suited in every respect
for business purposes, and in giving them an artistic finish at
the same time. Immigrants from many countries have settled
in this republic during the last decade.</p>

<p>European customs are strongly in evidence, the most noticeable
being lounging about cafés. The habit of living on the
sidewalk and in the street outside of cafés is the same here as that
which strikes one as being strange on his first visit to Paris and
other places in Continental Europe. One often has to maneuver
his way through little iron-legged tables and chairs, used for
refreshments. Some of the patrons are seen sipping black coffee
from cups no larger than half an eggshell; others may be found
drinking vari-colored liquids, of which there is a great variety,
and many will have cigarettes between their lips or between
their fingers. Still one cannot fail to note the improvement
these cafés are on the American saloon. There are no back
door entrances to these places; no front doors closed; no curtains&mdash;everything
open and above board. And, as with Europeans,
seldom is a person seen intoxicated or disorderly. Prosperity is
suggested by crowded cafés, for refreshments in Rio are
expensive.</p>

<p>Women seem to have an easy time in Brazil, in the capital, at
least, for men are seen looking after rooms in hotels, sweeping,
dusting&mdash;doing general housework.</p>

<p>Two meals a day seem to be all the Brazilians desire. A cup
of coffee is taken early in the morning, as the regular time for
breakfast is from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Dinner is served
from 5 to 7:30 o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Everything one buys in the Brazilian metropolis is expensive.
Manufactures are few&mdash;almost everything is imported, and the
customs duty is exorbitant. Street car fare, even, is double that
charged in most large cities. Small articles costing from ten to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
fifteen cents in the United States cost a milrei in Rio. Very
few things can be had for less than 33 cents. Soda water and
other soft drinks generally cost from 9 to 12 cents.</p>

<p>The Portuguese money system&mdash;reis and milreis&mdash;is that
of Brazil. The value of a milrei in American money is 33
cents, and a rei is equal to one-thirtieth of a cent. In financial
figures the dollar mark is used to denote milreis, but is placed
between the figures instead of in front&mdash;thus: 10$000.
Money is on the decimal system, 1,000 reis making a milrei.</p>

<p>One unaccustomed to Portuguese money is apt to feel perplexed
when presented with a bill for 50 cents. This is how a
50 cent dinner bill would look: 1$500. The figure 1 represents
a milrei&mdash;33 cents&mdash;and the 500 is 500 reis&mdash;half a milrei&mdash;16½
cents. One hundred reis is three cents in American
money. Only among the poorer class are coins of less than 100
reis in use. Paper bills are used for a milrei and larger sums.
The coins are mostly of nickel.</p>

<p>At São Paulo, over three hundred miles from Rio, woolen
and cotton mills have been established, and so far have proved
a good investment. English money is represented in this industry.
American money and machinery figure largely in the
development of the ore mines of that large country, so with
English capital erecting mills and American money opening and
developing mines business development is assured. Brazil produces
three-quarters of the world's annual consumption of
coffee. Rubber is another staple product of this republic.</p>

<p>The tropical scenery about Rio adds much to the attractiveness
of the capital of Brazil. High hills and mountains almost
circle both the harbor and city, and from these elevated points
one looks down through a dense growth of trees bearing flowers,
large blooming vines, wide-leaved palms, and clumps of high,
swaying bamboo&mdash;an expansive botanical garden&mdash;on to the
thousands of gray houses, with their red-tiled roofs. Similar
scenes and objects, attractive when viewed from less favored
vistas, seen through a tropical foreground, assume an enchanted
charm.</p>

<p>Though very little English printing is done here, a number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
good Portuguese daily newspapers are published, the offices being
equipped with linotype machines, web presses and stereotyping
machinery. The wages paid workers in this trade range from
$25 to $30 a week. As there is little manufacturing in Brazil,
and the tariff is so exorbitant on imports, together with high
dwelling rentals, $30 a week would not be considered good
wages in America under such conditions.</p>

<p>One seldom sees a Brazilian carrying bundles in his hands&mdash;such
as valises, etc. The people who make their living at that
sort of work carry a strap with them, which is thrown over the
shoulder. If two valises are to be borne, one is placed in front
and the other at the back, each fastened to the end of the strap.</p>

<p>Church bells here, as in the City of Mexico, are ringing in
most parts of the city all the time.</p>

<p>As a rule good photographs exaggerate and flatter objects, but
when looking at a picture associated with Rio de Janeiro, no
matter how pretty and artistic it may appear, one should not
discount the picture as being overdrawn, for Rio would very
likely carry away the honors if entered in a "beautiful city"
exhibit.</p>

<p>At Santos, another coffee mart of Brazil, enterprise was in
evidence when our ship drew up to a dock. This was the first
dock the ship pulled alongside of since leaving Southampton,
England. Santos is also the port for São Paulo. From this
place we continue southward.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred miles south of Rio, Montevideo, Uruguay,
is located at the delta of the River Plate. This city is the
capital of Uruguay. Most of the ships head for the River
Plate, and a great many sailing southward and through the
Straits of Magellan stop at this port, allowing passengers time
to look about the city. The River Plate (La Plata in Spanish)
spreads out at this point to a width of a hundred miles.
A great number of vessels sail up the Plate from time to time,
and it ranks high in the list of waterways of the world.</p>

<p>A glimpse of Montevideo revealed but little difference in
architecture to that of the Spanish style&mdash;brick and mortar.
Most of the dwelling houses are but one story in height, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
outside steps and stairways, however, being of white marble,
which gives the building a strikingly clean appearance.</p>

<p>More than one night in this city is required to become used to
the noise made by mouth whistles before a light sleeper can rest.
These are blown by the police, who keep in touch with each
other by this means.</p>

<p>A striking feature of Montevideo to one who has been in
Brazil is the large size of the Uruguayan. Deep-chested,
broad-shouldered and of good height, he appears to possess
double the strength of the Brazilian. While the people are of
dark complexion, no blacks are seen.</p>

<p>The money unit of Uruguay is higher than that of any
country in the world. It is known as the dollar, and its value
is $1.04.</p>

<p>Uruguay is a republic, its principal industry being agriculture
and stock raising. Flattering inducements are offered by that
government to immigrants who intend to make their home
there. These are in the nature of giving land to homeseekers,
the government even promising to stock the farms with cattle.</p>

<p>How little some of us who pay but passing attention to sea
commerce know of the tremendous volume of business carried
over the world in vessels, and the long runs made. At Rio de
Janeiro I left the ship that I sailed on from Southampton,
England, and after several weeks' stay in the Brazilian capital
continued my journey southward by another line, tickets being
interchangeable. The ship from Rio that landed Argentine
passengers at Montevideo proceeded southward to and through
the Straits of Magellan, to Valparaiso, Chile; up the Pacific
coast as far as Callao, the port for Lima, Peru, stopping at several
places between, distributing passengers and cargo at each.
From among the passengers Brazil, Uruguay, Argentine, Chile,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru received its quota. From England
to Callao six weeks' time was required to make the voyage.
The manner in which these merchantmen slip in and out of
bays, deep and shallow harbors, crawl up rivers and down again&mdash;into
commercial nooks of every character&mdash;reminds one of
the unexpected places to which the sun so often finds its way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Passengers from Great Britain seemed to be in the majority of
those traveling south of the equator. A greater number of men
than women are always to be found, though almost every ship
carries young women who will be on their way to meet and
marry their fiancés located in the interior of the South American
republics.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, capital of the Argentine republic, the New
York of South America, is located 124 miles up the River Plate.
Many entertain the opinion, gathered from newspaper accounts,
that, 6,000 miles south of New York, there is a good-sized city&mdash;Buenos
Aires. But what a difference there is between reading
about something and seeing it! It is said of a visitor that
"a look at New York will knock his eye out," and to travel
through the busy waterway of the big harbor of this South
American metropolis, and look through the dense thicket of
masts, spars, shrouds, ropes, pennants, flags and many-colored
funnels from ships that stretch for miles about the outer and
inner harbors, will surely cause one's eye to bulge with astonishment.
Such an influx of merchantmen visit this city at
certain periods of the year that, for as long as three and four
weeks, ships loll at anchor in the outer harbor before dock room
can be made for unloading their cargoes. The dock system is
good; and one may gather an idea of the harbor space available
when he learns the River Plate is thirty-five miles wide at
Buenos Aires. Up to the interior of South America ships ply
for 1,000 miles on the Plate to the Bolivian border, going up
loaded and sailing away to sundry parts of the world with
cargoes submerging the vessels to their water lines. It seemed
that every ship sailing south of the equator on the western side
of the Atlantic Ocean was headed for the River Plate or for
other coast ports of the Argentine.</p>

<p>A more intimate acquaintance with matters will reveal a
Briton at the helm of those ships of industry or the hidden
power behind the scene. Every passenger ship leaving a British
port for the River Plate carries brain and brawn from Great
Britain. English money figures prominently in the industrial
advancement of the Argentine, upward of a billion dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
having been expended in building railways and developing the
lands. The flower of Great Britain will be found engaged at
farming, connected with shipping, railroads, banking, or other
pursuits; and English advice on governmental legislation is
often sought.</p>

<p>In Buenos Aires one finds a busy city of nearly a million and
three-quarters of people, largely of a cosmopolitan character.
Sixteen big, well-printed daily newspapers of evening and morning
editions are published in this commercial center. Besides
the native, or Spanish language, are those printed in the French,
Italian, English, Swedish and other languages. The wages
paid artisans engaged in this industry do not compare with those
paid in the United States. The highest paid for newspaper
work is $3.50 a day, but $2.50 is the general daily wage, paid
monthly. Working time is seven and eight hours a day. On
the other hand, living expenses are higher than in American
cities. House rent is very high, and the price of food in ordinary
restaurants is as high, and generally higher, than that
charged in similar grade eating places in American cities.
Anent cheap living in other countries, about which one hears
so much in the United States, I have come to look upon such
alleged facts as mythical, for, speaking generally, I have yet to
come across them, and my unsuccessful search for these "much-cheaper"
places has not been from lack of effort.</p>

<p>The Argentine silver dollar is about the same value as the
Mexican dollar&mdash;44 cents. Another dollar is in use, however,
pertaining to shipping, customs charges and government tariff
of a general nature, known as the gold dollar, and is worth 96
cents. But it is the 44-cent dollar that is in general use for
retail purposes, wages, etc.</p>

<p>The great number of street cars running through and about
the city is in keeping with the large number of ships seen in the
harbor. There are only two streets in the business district&mdash;and
for a considerable distance beyond&mdash;on which street cars
do not run. Any one who has lived in busy centers will naturally
glance about when crossing streets, to see if the way is
clear. But in Buenos Aires one must be on the alert for street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
cars even when walking along walks between the crossings.
The Spanish system of laying out a town&mdash;narrow streets&mdash;is
the rule in Buenos Aires, in the older section of the city. To
build street car lines in the center of the streets would shut off
vehicular traffic to a great extent, as there is not room for a
truck and car to pass between the car line and the curb at the
same time. The car tracks, therefore, are laid at the side
of the street, by which plan car and vehicular traffic have room
to move together, but only in one direction. To make
matters worse, a "trailer," or two cars, are in use on many of
the lines. A sidewalk fender is secured to the rear platform of
the front car and to the forward platform of the "trailer."
This device is formed of strips of steel, bowed half-barrel shape,
which extends over the walk, and is attached to prevent pedestrians
from falling between the cars. The walks also are proportionately
narrow, affording room for only two persons to
pass at the same time. Were a person to become thoughtless or
one's mind be occupied with something foreign to street traffic,
while walking at the outer edge of the walk, or when stepping
to one side to allow another to pass, the half-barrel shaped
steel-strip fender is apt to scrape his leg. Being fearful of coming
in contact with the fender at any moment when walking the
streets prompts one to frequently look behind.</p>

<p>Ten cents (Argentine money) is the fare, equaling four
cents in American money. That sum will carry a passenger
from one end of a car line to the other. By reason of the narrow
streets, the two-car system, and the great number of cars
running on the different lines, tie-ups, turmoil and confusion
result. On boarding a car, there is no telling when one will
reach his destination. Improvements, however, were in progress.</p>

<p>Among the park squares of Buenos Aires (termed "plazas"
in Latin-speaking countries), Plaza de Mayo is perhaps the most
popular, and the first laid out in the Southern metropolis. This
plaza is located at one side of the business center of the city,
with government buildings, hotels, a cathedral, and business
houses fronting the four sides. Attractive palms adorn this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
pretty resting place, together with trees, shrubbery, flowers all
the year round, lawns and good walks. Historical memories,
dear to the Argentinian, however, prove of greater interest to
the populace than that wrought by the landscape gardener, as in
this section of the city in early days a decisive battle was fought
with Britishers. At one side of the square stands a memorial
shaft that marks the place of surrender to native forces by the
invaders early in the nineteenth century. Within the city
limits are six parks, a number of promenades, thirty-eight
squares, and many public gardens.</p>

<p>Avenida de Mayo is the promenade and show section of
Buenos Aires. Starting at Plaza de Mayo, it extends for
nearly a mile to Congreso, or Congress Hall. The Avenida is
one of the two streets on which cars do not run, and is the only
one of fair width in the busy center of the city. It is paved
with asphalt, most of the others being paved with stone blocks.
The best hotels line the Avenida, and the other buildings are of
attractive appearance. Prizes are offered by the city for the
best building designs, and the result of this municipal pride is
frequently observed. Through the Continental custom of
blocking the sidewalks in front of hotels and cafés with tables
and chairs one often finds difficulty in walking. The park system
of the city is creditable, and there are good boulevards in
the suburbs.</p>

<p>Here, too, as in Rio de Janeiro, one wonders what women do
to occupy their time, as men make the beds, do the dusting, look
after rooms, sweep the carpets, and do general household duties
one is so accustomed to seeing women perform in North
America. Neither is there any chance for a woman to earn her
living working in eating places, as men seem to have made that
source of livelihood a "closed shop" to women.</p>

<p>The clumsy way the Argentinian hitches horses to a cart
strikes one as odd. Carts, instead of trucks, are mostly in use.
Often three or four horses will be attached to a cart&mdash;one
horse between the shafts, and one hitched to the cart on each
side of the shaft horse. The horse in the lead will precede the
second horse by a space of from three to five feet, and the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
horse will be in advance of the shaft horse the same distance.
How the animals can see is a puzzle, for a heavy leather
fringe reaches from the top of the horse's head to the nose.</p>

<p>To see men embracing each other, with radiant faces, strikes
one from the North as an unusual custom. While Americans
greet with a handshake, Argentinians embrace.</p>

<p>A novel way to keep "park residents" from occupying seats
in some of the park squares is amusing. The park workers keep
moving the seats from shade to sun, and in the evening and on
cloudy days the "never-works" are told to "move on." But
the idlers enjoy sweet revenge from the fact that no one else has
a chance to sit in the shade in the daytime.</p>

<p>It is hard on one who has been used to three meals a day to
practice the principle of the old adage, "When in Rome, do as
the Romans do," for only two meals a day are served. Of
course, one gets coffee and rolls for breakfast, but more than
that brief menu is unknown to the Argentinian. The noontime
meal is called breakfast, and dinner is served about 7
o'clock.</p>

<p>Olives, potato chips, peanuts and cigarettes are accessories
that go with refreshments at the "sidewalk dining-rooms" in
Buenos Aires. People may be seen for hours taking sips of
liquid from small glasses, then a potato chip will be snapped
in two parts; next a few puffs of a cigarette; another sip; a
peanut shell is then cracked and a kernel eaten; another sip of
liquid; next an olive; more cigarette puffs, and so on.</p>

<p>Churches and church holidays being numerous, banks are
closed on these occasions for four or five days. What is known
as "the American Church" attracts many of the English-speaking
people of that city.</p>

<p>In addition to the Argentine being a grain and cattle country,
fruit trees and grapevines bear heavy yields. Fig and peach
trees, which are numerous, yield abundant good fruit, and some
bunches of grapes will half fill a water bucket.</p>

<p>Gentility is denoted in the Argentine by a long little fingernail.
A fingernail could not grow from one to two inches long
on the hand of one engaged in daily toil, for it would break off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Hence a man with a long fingernail is included in the list of
"retired" citizens.</p>

<p>The dwelling houses and buildings of all sorts are substantially
built. Brick is generally used, and this is covered with
several inches of cement. A courtyard is a feature of all
buildings, with a veranda around, and more rooms open on the
court than on the street. Strong iron bars protect the windows
in a great many instances, while the street doors are very heavy
and the locks big and strong. Most of the dwelling houses are
one and two stories in height, but some of the hotel and business
buildings are from three to seven stories high. The higher
buildings are of steel frame construction, which is known as
"the American system."</p>

<p>One will find splendid stores, with goods attractively displayed
in large, wide windows. Church buildings are numerous,
and some of the government buildings large and imposing.
Several of the newspapers are large, newsy and well printed.
Linotype machines, web presses&mdash;all the modern machinery in
use in the North&mdash;will be found in the emporium of South
America.</p>

<p>Portuguese is the language of Brazil, Spanish of the Argentine,
and any one going to these countries to transact business
without first acquiring an inkling of these languages will find
himself at a great disadvantage. The foreigner who can speak
both languages will succeed much better than the person who
sticks to his native tongue.</p>

<p>The pickpocket of Buenos Aires is said to be as deft at his
trade as are his clever colleagues in the City of Mexico. The
great number of thieves here may be the reason for the presence
of bars in front of windows, heavy doors and strong locks on
buildings.</p>

<p>I had work offered to me at my trade in that city, but one
who had been used to receiving $5 a day does not relish working
for $3 a day for the same duties. Besides, just then the surface
of my funds had been scarcely scratched.</p>

<p>I stopped at a boarding house, paying $2 a day for my keep,
occupying a small room next to the roof, with the only window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
a little larger than the port hole of a ship. It behooved one
to be promptly in his seat at the table at mealtime, in order to
prevent remonstrance that would justifiably be made by the
inner man until the next meal if the rules of strict punctuality
were not conformed to.</p>

<p>One notices an improvement in the condition of the working
people in both Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires over that seen
in Lisbon. Poverty is not a feature of either city, more particularly
in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>My fare from New York to Buenos Aires was $150, and the
distance traveled was 9,852 miles. From New York direct to
Buenos Aires is some 6,000 miles, and the fare, third-class, $90,
first-class, $240, there being no second-class rate. Third-class
travel is generally unsatisfactory, and a first-class ticket would
have cost more than I cared to spend on the first leg of my journey.
It was a 26-day sail from Southampton to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>From Buenos Aires direct across to Capetown, South Africa,
is 3,600 miles; by way of Madeira 9,500 miles, and second-class
fare $250. This large sum of money for a ticket set me inquiring
if there was no other way to get to South Africa without traveling
nearly half the distance around the world. A tramp ship
going to Asia and stopping at Durban, South Africa, for bunker
coal was one's only hope of avoiding the long and tedious journey
by way of Madeira and the big expense. Four different
captains who had received orders to sail to India did not want
to take a passenger with them, giving as their reason that "it
was against the Act" for tramp ships to carry travelers. The
fifth captain seen, however, agreed to take me across to Durban
for $50. Here was a saving of $200.</p>

<p>That being my first introduction to tramp ship travel, I faced
the voyage with some mistrust, as merchantmen, as a rule, are
slow, are not equipped with wireless telegraphy appliances, and
one does not know what may happen when sailing on the high
seas. But the captain had a good face, which inspired me with
confidence.</p>

<p>"Meet me at the British Consul's office to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock," the captain instructed, "for you'll have to ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
as an 'A. B.' (able-bodied seaman), as the 'Act' does not
allow us to carry passengers." "Aye, aye, sir," in sailor style,
was my answer to his instructions.</p>

<p>"How much are you going to pay this man?" asked
the consul. "Ten shillings ($2.40) a month," answered the
captain. "A pretty cheap 'A. B.'" sagely remarked the consul.</p>

<p>"The ship is the one with a red funnel, having a yellow circle
around it close to the top. <i>Bertha Clay</i> is her name. Be
aboard at 3 o'clock at the latest, as we shall sail between 3 and
4," was the final instruction by the captain.</p>

<p>"You found her all right?" the skipper remarked, when he
had come aboard his ship. A cargo of coal had just been
unloaded, and the dust was an inch deep on the deck.</p>

<p>Later a long blast from the whistle was blown, and in a short
time a rope from a tug had been fastened to the <i>Bertha Clay</i>,
when she was slowly drawn from the dock into the narrow
channel, which was solidly walled by ships. We had started
for "Darkest Africa."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p>

<h2>LEG TWO</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>The evening sun was sinking fast as we were being towed
from the inner harbor of the Argentine metropolis to the broad
expanse of gray-colored water of the River Plate.</p>

<p>Berths were short on the <i>Bertha Clay</i>, as the skipper had
informed me before I had boarded his ship I would have to
sleep in the chart room. Charts and other navigating paraphernalia
were kept in this room, and the wheel house was on
top of the chart room roof. "Sleep on the couch to-night,"
instructed the captain, "and to-morrow I'll try to have a berth
put up for you, which will be more restful."</p>

<p>Next morning found the tramp ship at sea, and behind, in
the distance, the panorama of Montevideo, built on a hillside,
was kept in view till lost to sight. "If you prefer land to sea
view," the captain remarked later, "take a good look yonder,
for, with the exception of a small, uninhabited island 1,200
miles to the east, it is the last land we shall see until we reach
the South African coast. That is Lobos Island, off the Uruguayan
coast, at which we are looking, on which large numbers
of seal assemble."</p>

<p>For six days out from the Plate the weather was summer-like,
and these were pleasantly spent sailing over a smooth sea.
Talent is generally found among sailors, and during the evening
some of the crew would sing, others dance, or boxing bouts
would take place; wrestling matches also were listed among the
means of entertainment. Then the weather changed for the
worse, and evening sports were discontinued.</p>

<p>The captain had brought with him eight sheep and a couple of
dozen live chickens, as this ship carried no ice. A sheep was
killed each week, and we had chicken twice weekly, so, between
the sheep and the chickens, we had fresh meat three times a
week.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep a look out for Gough Island," suggested the captain
to his first officer, "for it should be in sight by four o'clock."
At 4:15 the mate, opening the door, reported, "Land port
abeam, sir!" The island proved to be a small, rocky and uninhabited
sea "oasis." "No more land until we reach Africa,"
said the skipper.</p>

<p>The weather had grown stormy, the sea rough, and the
<i>Bertha Clay</i> was rolling badly. She pitched, tossed and rolled
so much, in fact, that the "A. B." had "callouses" on his hips
through being slammed back and forth against the sides of his
bunk in the chart room.</p>

<p>Masters of ships usually have an easy time at sea. After they
have left a port, the next few days are occupied in straightening
their accounts. From then on, if the weather be at all favorable,
little work is done save at noontime, when the sun is
sighted, by which means alone the course is maintained. Each
officer has a sextant, and from two to four of these are pointed
sunward from ten to fifteen minutes before the orb has reached
the zenith.</p>

<p>A captain of a tramp ship is generally sent from port to port
by cable from the owners to their agent. After the cargo has
been unloaded, he may remain in a port for days, or even weeks,
waiting for orders to sail; but sometimes he has little idea to
what part of the world he may be directed to go. The cable
directions may read "Capetown." He heads his ship for that
port, but does not know whence he will be sent until given
instructions by the company's agent on arrival.</p>

<p>The salary paid some sea captains is small, compared to the
responsibility assumed. English and other European shippers
pay masters of tramp ships from $100 to $130 a month, while
captains of American ships receive double that sum. Perquisites,
however, may come to a skipper in connection with his
calling. Coal firms generally give the master of a ship a commission
on fuel supplied, and chandlers maintain the same
custom when furnishing stores.</p>

<p>Sea charts with which captains are furnished are marvels of
exactness to a landsman, shoals, rocks, lights, jutting points of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
land, sea currents and courses being as clearly marked as are
rivers, turnpikes and railways on land maps. With a good
navigator there is little danger of getting off the course if the
sky be clear at noontime. It is in cloudy periods, when officers
cannot get their bearings from the sun, that danger may occur.</p>

<p>Rainy weather and clear days are the same to a sailor aboard
merchantmen. Though sailors on a tramp ship rest on Sunday,
firemen and officers have no day off. Chinese, Arabs and
Indians, the latter called "lascars," form the crew of a large
number of British ships. From $12 to $16 a month were the
wages then paid. On American ships white sailors receive $40
a month.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles a day was all the <i>Bertha Clay</i> was
traveling. Her smoke funnel was white with salt from the
waves of the sea dashing against it. Some of the officers
gathered in the little saloon every evening, when the hours were
whiled away until bedtime by indoor amusements.</p>

<p>Sea birds of the Southland are different from those that
accompany ships above the equator. No traveler who has the
noble albatross as a companion can refrain from devoting hours
and hours of time during a voyage to watching and admiring
the smooth, graceful movements of this large bird. Sometimes
as many as a hundred of these handsome soarers may be seen
encircling the ship for as long as an hour at a time, seldom
flapping their wings. In far southern waters the albatross
generally joins an outgoing vessel from 200 to 400 miles from
shore, and is not seen when a ship is the same distance from
land at the other side of the ocean, although companions for
weeks before. Its color is generally gray and white, but some
are snow white, and occasionally brown-colored ones are seen
with the others. These birds are as large as a swan, some
measuring twelve feet from wingtip to wingtip. But many a
sailor has lost his life when falling from a vessel in parts of
the sea inhabited by the albatross. The great bird will pounce
on anything it sees in the water, and, being so strong, the beak
will penetrate the skull of a person at the first attack. Navigators
say that it will not live during transit across the equator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
The mollemoke is another companion sailors have with them
when traveling south of the equator. This bird, while not so
large, resembles the larger specie both in poise and color, and
also mingles with the albatross during a voyage. Feeding on
garbage thrown from the ship seemed to be the chief attraction
to the fowl. A very pretty sea bird seen in far southern waters
is the Cape pigeon. The pigeon is as large as a sea-gull, but
in color is like the guinea fowl&mdash;spotted white and black&mdash;but
of much brighter color. The snowbird is another companion
that follows a ship in the southern seas, but only in
sections where the weather has become chilly. The petrel is
also found in these parts, and still another, a small, dark colored
bird, no larger than a swallow, appears in large numbers at
intervals. Sailors call these Mother Carey's chickens. All
these fowl are one's unfettered companions while traveling
through watery Southland, save an occasional whale. Sea-gulls
do not appear.</p>

<p>It was eighteen days since we sailed from Buenos Aires, and
twelve of these had been stormy. The "A. B." was near the
captain while he studied the chart, at 9 o'clock one evening,
when the mate came into the chart room. "Mr. Jones," said
the captain to the first officer, "keep a sharp lookout, as we
should see the Cape of Good Hope light by 10 o'clock, or
thereabouts." "Aye, aye, sir," he replied, as he passed out, and
then scaled the ladder to the bridge. The sea had calmed as
we neared the African coast. Less than an hour later the
skipper and the "A. B." were chatting, when the door opened.
The mate, putting his head between the door and jamb, in sea
manner, announced: "Flash light port abeam, sir!" It was
the Cape of Good Hope light. We had reached another continent&mdash;the
African.</p>

<p>For five more days we sailed in sight of the green, treeless
hills of South Africa, using glasses frequently, as may be imagined,
eager to see houses, cattle and grain fields. Finally we
came in sight of the Bluff, the beacon of Port Natal. Soon we
were opposite the entrance channel to the harbor, when anchor
was cast. Shortly after a harbor boat was seen coming through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the channel. Later a rowboat, manned by Zulus, headed
toward the <i>Bertha Clay</i>, in which was a white man dressed in
a white suit. The captain shouted to the man in white, asking
if we could get into the harbor before night. It was then
nearly sunset. The answer from the rowboat was, "I'm
coming." This was the skipper's first trip to a country where
white clothes were worn, and he mistook the man in the rowboat
to be the port doctor. One unfamiliar with customs in
that part of South Africa&mdash;or, in fact, anywhere&mdash;would
never dream of seeing a grizzled sea pilot dressed in an immaculate
white suit of clothes. It proved to be the man who was to
steer our ship safely to harbor. "All well?" he inquired&mdash;the
usual salute&mdash;when his rowboat had reached speaking distance
of the tramp ship. "All well," replied the master of the
<i>Bertha Clay</i>. When the pilot had drawn alongside our vessel,
he began to wriggle up the rope ladder at the side of the ship,
the usual means of boarding and disembarking under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>We anchored in the harbor as twilight was hastily changing
to darkness. "Supper is ready," announced the steward when
the anchor chain was silenced. As ship food had no charm for
the "A. B." when land food was available, he hurriedly made
steps for the ladder at the side. This settled matters concerning
eating supper aboard ship that evening, as the captain
shouted, "Wait." Soon the skipper also started down the
ladder, and the master of the <i>Bertha Clay</i> and his passenger had
dinner ashore.</p>

<p>We had stepped foot on Leg Two.</p>

<p>The captain wished the "A. B." to return to the ship and
sleep in his recently vacated bunk in the chart room that night&mdash;"the
last night," as he put it&mdash;but my feeling of relief
at the thought of not having longer to occupy that "cabin," in
which the bedclothing had often been made damp through waves
dashing against and over the ship, together with several inches
of water at times covering the floor, might be compared to those
that one would experience on leaving a "house of trouble."</p>

<p>"You'll have to come to the port office in the morning and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
get paid off and discharged," remarked the captain, after we had
finished eating the best meal we had had for nearly a month.
Meeting at the time designated, the formality of paying off was
gone through with, in accordance with maritime law. The
"A. B." was handed $2.40 for his "work" during the voyage,
but the money did not reach his pockets, as it was handed back
to the genial skipper. The provisions of the "Act" had been
complied with&mdash;in name.</p>

<p>The <i>Bertha Clay</i>, with her bunkers full of coal, left the
following day for Cochin-China&mdash;6,000 miles further east&mdash;thirty
days' more sailing.</p>

<p>"Sixty cents a day" (the minimum legal charge for a person's
food on English ships) "is all it will cost you if you will
come with us," inducingly spoke the captain to his discharged
"able seaman," while shaking hands warmly, a short time
before the <i>Bertha Clay</i> sailed out of the harbor. The skipper's
generous offer was declined.</p>

<p>The passenger left behind sought the highest point of the
seashore to watch the tramp ship sail on her initial stretch to
Asia. She dipped her nose in the sea and wobbled and pitched
as she had done for twenty-three days during her former voyage.
It was not long before only an outline of the hulk was in view.
Then that disappeared altogether, when all that remained in
sight was the smoke funnel. Soon that also had faded to but
a speck, and a short time later the <i>Bertha Clay</i> became hidden
in a hazy horizon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>With a population of a hundred thousand, Durban is the
chief seaport of South Africa. Located on the Indian Ocean, it
is known also as Port Natal. Among the inhabitants, colored
people of varied races comprise two-thirds of the population.
With the native black there is the Indian, or Hindu, Arabs,
Malays and half-castes from islands located near the East
African coast. The phrase "Darkest Africa" is even more
emphasized by the presence of the dark races that are not
natives of the country.</p>

<p>Untidiness and unsanitary conditions invariably prevail where
black races are in the majority, especially so where the percentage
is three to one white person; but a pleasant surprise is
met with here in this respect, as few cities anywhere surpass
Durban in cleanliness, whether composed entirely of white
people or a predominating number of blacks. Almost the
whole white population is British.</p>

<p>To the east and south, as one comes through a channel from
the sea to the harbor, a ridge of land known as the Bluff,
thickly verdured with low trees and wild flowers, offers such
an inviting setting to a visitor that one forms a favorable opinion
of Durban before he has stepped off a ship. That foreground
is as green in the winter months as during the summer,
for it is summertime in Durban the year round. After having
passed through the channel into the bay, the harbor is seen
landlocked on one side by the city, and on the other side and
end by the evergreen Bluff and more verdure. It is Durban's
splendid harbor, reasonable port dues, up-to-date facilities for
coaling ships, and splendid docks that has gained for her the
title of premier seaport of the South Indian Ocean. Her modern
maritime facilities are the result of energy by the Durban
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
business man more than to natural advantages, for the entrance
channel had to be dug out and the harbor dredged.</p>

<p>The business houses are built of brick, cement and stone, some
of them being seven stories high. The stores are large, of fine
appearance, with attractive windows. No place of Durban's
size can boast of better buildings or better stores.</p>

<p>One of the largest and best built structures to be found south
of the equator is the Durban Town Hall. This building, of
brick and cement, is a city block in size and three stories in
height. The scope of this hall may be understood when it is
mentioned that under its roof is contained a public museum, an
art gallery, public library, theater, councilors' chambers, besides
offices for the city officials. The building is not only large and
imposing, but the architects have succeeded in giving the structure
an artistic finish. The Town Hall of to-day should meet
the requirements of the Durban Corporation centuries hence,
and would be a credit to a city of a million inhabitants.</p>

<p>A good bathing beach and a well-laid-out and well-appointed
park do not, as a rule, go together, but one finds this dual comfort
at this part of the Indian Ocean. Scattered about the
terraced lawn have been built substantial kiosks and pagodas,
with thatched roofs, which lend to the surroundings a decidedly
Oriental air. These have been provided with comfortable
seats, and, with the soft breezes nearly always coming from the
Indian Ocean, enviable restfulness is assured to even nervous
wrecks. Then stone walls, with alcoves built in to add to the
seating capacity of the park, together with flowering vines
creeping up and over and then drooping, form a means of
shelter and rest, adding more attractiveness to the surroundings.
Above the beach and park are splendid hotels, some without
doors, and all with wide, inviting verandas.</p>

<p>Sharks&mdash;man-eaters&mdash;are so numerous along the Natal
coast that the bathing enclosure is closely studded with iron rods
to prevent the voracious sea beasts from mangling and killing
bathers, as would happen were there no means provided to keep
the sharks away from the holiday-maker.</p>

<p>The Berea is a residential section of Durban, and for landscape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
and floral effect is a notable feature. On a range of hills
rising several hundred feet, overlooking the business portion of
the city and the Indian Ocean, many Durbanites live in broad-verandaed
homes, shaded with semi-tropical flowering trees,
perpetually blooming plants, vines growing so luxuriantly that
the porches, and often the sides, of the houses are shut in by a
green and floral portière, as it were. Added to this attractiveness
are various species of palms and clusters of giant and
Japanese bamboo. Some of the flowered hedges enclosing these
building plots are so gorgeous in rich color and shape as to
make a Solomon green with envy.</p>

<p>The flambeau tree, indigenous to the Island of Mauritius&mdash;"the
flower garden tree," it may be termed&mdash;is conspicuous
on the Berea, both as to numbers and floral beauty. This tree,
with fern-shaped leaf, does not grow over twenty-five feet in
height, but it is of a spreading nature, its shade in some instances
measuring fifty feet across&mdash;twice its height. It is in flower
about a month, from the middle of December to the middle of
January&mdash;Junetime south of the equator. The color of the
flower is a bright red, as large and the shape of a sewing thimble,
and grows in clusters of eight and ten in number. When
in bloom, this bright red aerial garden may be seen from a
distance of a mile, so the reader can picture what a gorgeous
floral effect is displayed when hundreds of these handsome trees
are in flower at the same time.</p>

<p>The rosebush seemed to be the only plant of the nature of
bush or tree that overrides lines, climates and seas. It is no
doubt the most cosmopolitan plant that grows, and is to be
seen in about the same beauty and diffuses its fragrance in the
same degree in nearly all parts of the world. All the trees seen
growing south of the equator appeared foreign to those growing
in the United States.</p>

<p>The Christ thorn&mdash;said to be the same as the one that
pierced the brow of the Savior on Mount Calvary&mdash;grows
abundantly in Natal. In some instances the bush is used for
hedge fences, and when allowed to grow to a height of from
two to four feet it makes a spiky obstruction, as the prongs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
an inch in length, grow numerous on the stock, little thicker
than a knitting needle, and are almost as sharp as a sewing
needle. The thorn, which is of a creeping nature, like a grapevine,
is more generally used as a border for a flower pot,
however. As its name naturally calls up memories of the deep-stained
crime of nearly 2,000 years ago, one scrutinizes it
closely. The Christ is a flowering thorn, and the flower is red,
not larger than a wild strawberry's. These grow in a group
from one stem, each cluster numbering from two to ten flowers&mdash;always
even&mdash;two, four, six, eight and ten&mdash;never in odd
numbers.</p>

<p>Some of the trees growing here bud and bloom twice a year.
These interesting changes do not take place in the same way
that nature does her work in the colder climates&mdash;by the leaves
falling off in the fall of the year and the buds coming in the
spring. With these trees the old leaf remains until forced off
the limb by the new bud. About six weeks' time is required for
nature to change from the old to the new. During this period
new buds bulge from the tips of the limbs, when the old leaf
will fall to the ground. This change is gradually progressing,
until sections of the tree offer a clean, fresh, bright, green-leafed
appearance, while on other parts the dull-green, dust-soiled
leaf offers a striking contrast. Between the months of
February and March and August and September the new leaf
replaces the old.</p>

<p>There is really little timber in South Africa, as the trees grow
low and are of a spreading character. Naturally, the shade cast
by them is much wider than that afforded by high trees. Where
brush grows, it is found to be a dense thicket or jungle, in which
monkeys disport themselves at will, and is often the home of the
python also, a reptile frequently seen along the Natal coast.
Shooting monkeys in the brush is a common amusement.</p>

<p>Outside the city are banana plantations, and sometimes
patches of corn and pumpkins. In order to prevent crops from
being partly eaten by monkeys, laborers are out in the fields
at daylight setting traps to catch the "missing links" or shooting
them. The monkeys are very destructive to crops growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
in fields bordered by bushy land. A monkey's gluttony often
renders his cunning of no avail, and for that trait he becomes
an easy prey. Calabashes grow everywhere in South Africa,
and it is by this vegetable the monkey is generally trapped.
The calabash is dug out, or partly so, and cornmeal, calabash
seeds and other monkey edibles are put inside and then made
fast. A small hole, just large enough for a monkey to wriggle
his supple fingers in and contracted paw through, is made in the
vegetable. When no one is about, the monkey makes a start
for the calabash trap and is soon eager to find out what is
inside. He then begins working his paw through the opening,
and when he has reached the cornmeal, seeds and other bait he
grabs a handful. It is then that his gluttony proves his downfall.
The opening that admitted his empty paw is too small to
allow his clenched fist to be withdrawn, so he pulls and tugs
for hours to get his paw through the hole, but will not let go
of the food even while being put to death by his captors.</p>

<p>"Are there any automobiles in South Africa?" asked a
friend in a letter. Perhaps others will ask a similar question
concerning the presence of other modern appliances in a far-off
part of the world. One will not meet with elevated railroads,
tunnels under wide rivers, underground railway systems, or
buildings from twenty to fifty stories in height, for the reason
that the cities of South Africa are not large enough to require
these modern public utilities; but one will meet with modern
electric light systems, telephone, telegraph and wireless telegraphy
systems, automobiles, motorcycles, motor trucks, most up-to-date
fire-fighting apparatus, modern farm machinery, typesetting
machines, web presses&mdash;all the modern machinery and appliances
with which cities of the same size in the North are
equipped will be found in the cities of the far Southland.</p>

<p>White drill clothes are worn by two-thirds of the men of
Durban; also white shoes and a white, light-weight helmet. A
suit costs from $2.50 to $6, and a wardrobe contains from three
to half a dozen. In addition to the drill, a majority of mechanics
and clerks can vary their apparel by wearing woolen,
flannel and even evening-dress suits. Women also generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
adhere to white clothes and often a helmet similar to the style
worn by men, together with white shoes, white hand-bag, and
white parasol.</p>

<p>The standard of intelligence of the people is high. A majority
in the coast cities are from the United Kingdom. Scotch
and English are the more numerous, the Irish and Welsh being
less in evidence. Among a group of men, the colonials (white
persons born in South Africa of British parents) are nearly always
in the minority.</p>

<p>It is only in very small towns in South Africa where a public
library would not be open to all who wished to take advantage
of its benefits. Durban is well supplied with public schools,
a technical school open for both day and night classes; Y. M. C. A.,
Y. W. C. A. institutions, splendid library, art gallery,
museum; is thickly spired and turreted with good church buildings;
and, for recreation, there is a promenade, fringed with
beautiful palms and shady trees, with seats under them, for a
mile on one side, and the bay on the other; parks and sports
grounds scattered throughout the city; a botanical garden and
a zoological park. All these institutions of education, religion
and recreation are to be found 10,000 miles from America, on
the fringe of "Darkest Africa."</p>

<p>In order that the reader may clearly distinguish between
white and black, a note of the distinctive terms in use here
might not be out of place. A "native" is a kafir or negro; a
"colonial" is one born in South Africa of white parents, generally
applied to English-speaking people; Dutch means a Boer,
and Boer means Dutch; the word "Africander" also means
Dutch. But for all whites&mdash;Dutch, colonial, and foreign-born&mdash;the
word "European" is used to designate the white
from the black. The word "white" is seldom used. Indian
coolie, or Indian, is a native of India, or of Indian parentage.
"Colored" means a person of Malay and white blood. Half-castes
are of negro and white blood. A "boy" means a kafir
servant or a laborer. A native servant 40 years of age would
be called a "boy."</p>

<p>House servants in South Africa are native boys, and Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
women and girls are often employed as nurses. Occasionally
one sees a native woman looking after children; but the native
boy&mdash;the "umfaan," as he is called in the Zulu language&mdash;from
10 to 18 years of age, is the standby as a house servant
in the Province of Natal. The houseboy wears clothes that
denote his occupation, and generally presents a neat appearance.
His wage varies from $2 to $5 a month. Most of the umfaans
make good servants, particularly the Zulu boys. Unlike his
American brother, he is an early riser.</p>

<p>"Umfaan peril&mdash;protection for the children"&mdash;is the light
in which a great many of the Europeans see their dependency
on the umfaan as the servant. While Indian women and some
native women look after the children, more umfaans will be
seen wheeling baby carriages than black maids. Such a thing
as a European servant is almost unheard of in South Africa.
So, how to have the children looked after by other than black
male servants is a burning question in the province. Conventions
are held regularly at the instance of women's children
protection societies, leagues and similar organizations, at which
the ablest minds of the country deal with the "umfaan peril."
But no solution has yet been found to check the degradation
that follows in the wake of such a system of taking care of
children. Men and women who have made a study of the
"peril," and who are familiar with customs, are loth to place
all the blame for undesirable conditions on the native, nevertheless.
A large number of native girls are not allowed by their
parents to come to the cities or towns as servants. While they
live in the kraal on the veld no concern is felt for the future
of the girls; but so soon as they leave the native hut to go into
service in the towns their future is in doubt. So, with no native
girls to be had as servants, the umfaan's services for the
present are indispensable.</p>

<p>South Africa has proved an Arcadia for a great number of
poor girls. Mill and shop girls of Great Britain who had
dreamed of being the wife of a man dressed in white clothes
from feet to head, of living in a wide verandaed house, trellised
all around, with flowering vines climbing all about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
porch, with the picture varied by the hum of bees or humming
birds; with palms, exotics and flowers growing about the house
and yard; with bearing banana plants, mango trees and rows
of luscious pineapples growing in the yard&mdash;all encompassed
by a flowering hedge of big, bright hibiscus bush; with a foreground
of a steepled city and a broad blue ocean, and a background
of spreading fern-leafed trees emblazoned with scarlet
and lavender-colored flowers; with an ayah (Indian maid) to
be at her beck and call and a black boy to do the housework
and bring her breakfast to her room; to be drawn from her
home to the shopping center of the city and back by a big and
swift Zulu ricksha puller, with long cow horns secured to each
side of his head&mdash;that dream has come true to thousands of
poor girls who have married in this section of South Africa.</p>

<p>Most wives from Great Britain, however, prove white elephants
to men living in the colonies. They are eternally going
"home," as the British Isles are termed, and the husband's nose
is "kept on the grindstone" to meet the expense required. The
home "holiday" is seldom less than six months, and is frequently
eighteen months, during which period the husband is
maintaining two homes&mdash;the one in the colony and sending
money to Great Britain to meet the expense of his family in
that country. On the other hand, the climate of Southern
Natal and Zululand is hard on the white woman. The easy
life they live, and their fascinating surroundings, are not reflected
in face or in physique. It is unusual to see a buxom,
rosy-cheeked woman or girl in Durban. The face is white and
features lifeless. The climate in that part of South Africa
seems to not only make them jaded, but crow's-feet and deeper
wrinkles mark the faces of most women at a period in life when
the features should be free of these ageing signs. The children
suffer from the climate to the same degree as the women, most
of them having thin bodies, thin arms, thin blood and spindled
legs. Men also are affected by the climate, but not to the same
degree as women and children. Illustrative of the size of men
in Southern Natal, it may be noted that ready made suits of
clothes of size 40 and over are not kept in stock by merchants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
as there is no call for them; few men attain that girth. It is
doubtful also if one could find a collar of size 17.</p>

<p>The horse of Natal is a hungry-looking beast. This is owing
to the grass generally being of a wiry nature, which the animal
cannot digest, and a better quality, if eaten when dew is on it,
proves very injurious to the system. Smoldering fires are lit
in stables in the evening so that the smoke will keep mosquitoes
from the premises. These insects are said to inject disease
germs into any horse they bite. Large, vicious flies prove another
menace to horses. The bite of these flies often draws
blood, and as a result white hairs grow from the bitten parts.
So many of these white hair spots appear on the bodies of black
and bay horses that they often give a beast the appearance of
being an iron-gray color. In certain sections of the Province
of Natal horses cannot live.</p>

<p>Favored with a delightful climate and a good bathing beach,
Durban is a noted winter resort in that part of the world.
The weather during the "season"&mdash;from May to October&mdash;is
like the American Indian summer save for the absence of
Jack Frost. At this time of year people from Johannesburg
and other sections of the high veld come in large numbers to
this point of the coast to spend their vacations. Circuses also
pay their annual visits; hotel-keepers raise prices; rooming house
proprietors double rates; fakirs are numerous; talented tramps&mdash;street
singers&mdash;are heard in front of hotels, looking for any
spare change that may come from verandas and windows;
Zulu ricksha pullers become ambitious for an extra "holiday"
fare&mdash;every one tries to get rich off the visitor, and the air
is charged with music, merriment and life at every turn.</p>

<p>In the way of amusement, moving pictures predominate, although
theatrical people of world reputation frequently tour
South Africa. Concerts in the Town Hall Sunday evenings,
held under municipal auspices, are a popular form of entertainment,
these being in charge of the borough organist, a city
official. Military bands in the gala season entertain the populace
morning, afternoon and evening at the Beach and in parks.
Besides these attractions, boating, fishing, horse racing, military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
sports tournaments, and the general athletic sports figure largely
in the life of the place.</p>

<p>Dwellings are nearly always at a premium, these renting for
from $15 to $35 a month; but few houses are available for the
lesser sum. The standard of living may be gauged by these
charges, as people receiving small salaries could not pay high
rentals. The wages of clerks, salesmen and mechanics range
from $65 to $100 a month. In many Durban homes will be
found a piano, a phonograph, good furniture, often a good collection
of horns and skins, pictures&mdash;the home of no workingman
of any country could be better furnished than the Durban
breadwinner's.</p>

<p>"Did you attend the funeral yesterday?" was asked of a
lady whose relative had been buried the day before. "Oh,
no!" she answered, much surprised at the question; "only men
attend funerals." The absence of women at subsequent burials
proved this to be the custom here. A body must be put under
ground within 24 hours after death. Were a person to die at
7 o'clock in the morning, the burial would take place during
the day. When information has been given that a person has
died, it is understood that the funeral will take place in a few
hours.</p>

<p>One making a visit to the black belts would use good judgment
were he to leave behind the word "woman" when applied
to white women. "Woman" in these countries is used
only when speaking of black or colored persons. "Lady" is
always used when referring to a white woman. One will find
a similar distinction in vogue in the negro sections of the United
States.</p>

<p>"Toff" is an English term used to denote a good dresser&mdash;a
sort of dandy. As most of the clothes worn by men are
tailor-made, a great many "toffs" may be seen in Durban.
The cheapest suit one can have made costs $22, but from $25
to $40 is the general price.</p>

<p>Natal, unlike the other provinces of South Africa, has always
been English, particularly the coast section, which accounts for
few manufacturers being in evidence from other countries. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
among American products are shoes, sewing machines and
illuminating oil. Some powerful locomotives in use are of
American manufacture and are imported chiefly to pull trains
up heavy grades. The cooking stove in general use here is the
kerosene oil sort, most of them of American make. In recent
years, exports from the United States to the sub-continent (as
South Africa is often termed) have increased to the creditable
figures of 35 to 40 per cent.</p>

<p>"Will you please look at the fireless stove?" a saleslady
asked, as a group of women passed a "kitchen" stall in a fair
ground on a provincial fair day. Turning about, there was a
dish of baked beans, seldom seen away from America; an apple
pie, an article of food as scarce in foreign parts as hens' teeth;
a roast chicken, soda biscuits (called scones in British territory)
and baked potatoes. The whole outfit had America stamped
on it very strongly. All the women stopped to witness the
fireless stove "demonstration." "Where's the fire?" asked one
of the women. Then the "demonstration" began, both in action
and word. Her auditors looked with staring eyes and
open-mouth as the agent showed them and explained its working.</p>

<p>Comparatively few Americans live in the Province of Natal,
as at a luncheon given by the American Consul's wife to her
countrymen "a table held us all"&mdash;thirty being present. Invitations
had been sent to a larger number, but as some of these
were missionaries located in remote places of the country all
did not attend. The luncheon was served on a Fourth of
July, and what a pleasant gathering it proved to be. Some of
those present had been away from their native country as long
as forty years. Pleasant chats, speeches, toasts&mdash;the season of
good fellowship that prevailed at that Fourth of July gathering,
when we were all 10,000 miles from home, will remain
among the longest cherished memories that those present will
carry with them through life.</p>

<p>Though lighting, water, a telephone system and street railways
are owned by the city, municipal ownership does not
augur cheaper prices in Durban, in spite of the fact that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
rates charged the consumer and patron insure the city not
only a fair return on the capital invested, but generally a snug
surplus is shown besides. Street cars are of double-deck style,
but the fare is high. The system of paying is by "stage"&mdash;four
cents from stage to stage, and the distance between
"stages" is so arranged that the city receives about three cents
a mile from its patrons. Conductors and motormen are Europeans.</p>

<p>While the street car system gives employment to white men,
it is the only department of the city that does so. The park
system and the street department work is done entirely by
Indian coolies, who receive from $3 to $5 a month. They are
the most hungry looking, bony, spindle-legged lot of creatures
one might set eyes on; but it is largely due to this cheap help
that the Durban treasury is in such good condition.</p>

<p>The Indian coolie is tricky, treacherous, lying, lazy, dirty
and repulsive. He has about his loins a rag just big enough to
cover his nakedness, while the wrapping around his head&mdash;his
puggaree&mdash;is as large as a bed sheet. In other words, he makes
a loin piece out of a handkerchief, but requires yards of cloth
for a head covering.</p>

<p>Sugar growing being the principal industry of southern Natal,
the Indian coolie was imported to work in the sugar-cane fields.
Tea also is grown in the southern part of the province, and Indians
are used in that industry, receiving from $3 to $5 a month
and board. As his main food is rice, board does not cost much;
and as he sleeps in any sort of a shed, the sugar grower is not
put to great expense for beds and bedding. The coolie used to
be brought to South Africa under what was termed the "indenture
system," the indentureship periods being from three to
five years, during which he could not leave his employer. It
was a mild form of slavery. At the end of his indentureship
he was generally shipped back to India, but could be re-employed
there and return to Africa. The sugar company paid
his transportation either way. But that expense did not greatly
shrink the growers' pocketbooks, as the coolie was shipped in the
hold of a ship, which, when packed with this class, resembled a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
great ant-hill. Serving two and three terms of successive indentureship
to the same employer gained for him his freedom,
when he could remain in Natal. From then on he became a
curse. The Dutch came in full control of South Africa on
May 30, 1910, and a month later marked the end of indentured
coolies entering the sub-continent.</p>

<p>As is generally known, Indian girls become mothers at the
age of from 12 to 14 years. Added to a resulting abnormal
birth rate, compared with Europeans, polygamy is also a custom
of the Indians. Thus will readily appear the great danger to
the white interest where the Indian gets a foothold.</p>

<p>The Indian patronizes his own people, and for this reason
many of the Arab and Hindu merchants soon become wealthy.
They aim to oust the white man wherever and whenever they
can do so. Their standard of living is so much lower, and their
employees work for so much less than the white merchant must
pay European help, that they can undersell the white in most
lines of business. Some of the wealthiest men in the province
are Indian merchants.</p>

<p>Most of the money in use in South Africa is gold&mdash;gold
sovereigns&mdash;and silver. The gold sovereign is what the Indian
is after. His savings are sent to India in gold. Through
the Durban post office was sent not long since 65,000 gold sovereigns.
Bankers and business men appealed to the government
to put a stop to sending this metal out of the country, and
when that method of depleting the gold currency had been
checked, it was sent to India secretly, most of it in packing
boxes, there being a large trade between the two countries.</p>

<p>The Indian having become a running sore on the financial
and social body of Natal, the government has tried to tax the
race out of the country. The legal age of a girl is placed at
thirteen years and that of a boy at sixteen years. The tax on
"legal" aged Indians is $15 a year. So, if an Indian father
had three girls over thirteen years of age, and two sons over
sixteen, making seven in the family of legal age, the head tax
would be $105. To impose such an exorbitant tax on poor, low
paid people seems a hardship. No "melting pot" that ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
simmered will assimilate the Indian with the white race, however.
They bring with them filthy habits and weird customs,
and live the life of an Indian in whatever part of the world
they may be located.</p>

<p>The destruction of the "gods"&mdash;Mohurrum festival&mdash;is
one of the great holidays of the Indians in Natal. This is the
closing climax of a Mohammedan ten-day festival. The festival
takes place each year, which shows that Indians do not
worship stale gods, as a new one comes into existence ten days
after the drowning of the old gods. The gods on this occasion
were drowned in the Umgeni River, about three miles
from Durban.</p>

<p>The fantastic hearses, in design a strange mixture of mosque
and pagoda, made up of bamboo framework covered with bright
colored paper and lavishly decorated with tinsel and gaudy
ornaments, most of them surmounted by the star and crescent
on a dome, emblematic of the Moslem faith, were followed by
Indian women in brightly colored garments, and grotesquely
painted men scantily clad in loin cloths, weird headpieces, and
other trappings, who conveyed the gods to the river. Above
the noise that followed this gay holiday crowd, bent on the
destruction of Indian gods, could be heard the monotonous and
ear-racking din of the tomtom, together with a prehistoric bagpipe
here and there, and these were the only musical instruments
in use to demonstrate the feelings of this motley crowd.
The pagodas are called "taboots," and when these came to a
halt&mdash;they were drawn by men&mdash;the "tigers," men besmeared
with lead, ochre and yellow-colored mud and grease from head
to foot, would give exhibitions of contortions, which must have
been pleasing to the slowly moving gods. At the river where
the gods were to meet their death had gathered a great crowd
of Indians, natives and Europeans to witness the last part played
in the Mohurrum fast and festival. "Taboot" after "taboot"
was tipped and hurled into the stream, after the priests
had taken rice and other grain from it, which they tossed into
a small fire burning in an urn. The shallow river was swarming
with youngsters, and no sooner had a "taboot" reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the water than the boys were at it, and in a short time it was a
shapeless wreck.</p>

<p>On the shore of the Indian Ocean a group of Hindus were
observing a repulsive form of the Buddhist religion. About a
dozen in number, they assembled round a brass urn, six inches
across and three deep, in which burned an oil fire. Half of
this number formed what we may call an orchestra. Two of
the instruments were tomtoms and the others rounded pieces of
wood, bored out, as large as a croquet ball, and with brass
bells attached. These were put over the players' hands, rattling
as they moved their wrists, the other members at the same time
chanting a dump. Close to the urn stood a cone-shaped
wooden frame, two feet high and eighteen inches at the base,
covered with flowers. To the rear lay three live hens, with
strings tied to their legs.</p>

<p>The Hindus then started toward the water to the accompaniment
of bells and tomtoms. Leading were three men, the
one between, who appeared nervous, being aided by those on
each side. One of the trio had thick, black hair reaching to
the waist, but none wore head covering. When the three had
waded in up to the armpits, the center man was ducked a number
of times. The music then ceased for a short period, after
which all returned to the urn. The Indian who had been immersed
turned out to be a convert to this fanatical sect.</p>

<p>The orchestra resumed the chant, the man with the long
hair and the convert kneeling by the fire, the third one, a
priest, standing. The former began bending his body backward
and forward, his head touching the sand at each movement,
also running his fingers through his hair. The convert
followed the actions of the other. Both worked themselves
into a state of weakness, verging on collapse, during which
their hands, at times, came in contact with the flame in the
urn, but none of the members made any effort to turn their
hands from the fire, which, of course were burned. At this
stage of the ceremony both men, their eyes rolling and only the
whites showing, lay on the sand, exhausted. The chant ceased.
The priest approached the apparently lifeless Indians with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
phial in his hands. He next placed the open end of the bottle
to the nose of one, then to the other, the Hindus raising themselves
to their knees as the orchestra resumed.</p>

<p>The half-revived convert then put out his tongue, the priest
advancing with what looked like an oyster fork in his hand.
The orchestra stopped&mdash;all was silent. He next took hold of
the dazed, hand-burnt disciple's tongue in one hand, and forced
the tines of the fork through that member with the other; then,
quickly stepping to the cone, took two flowers&mdash;lavender and
yellow in color&mdash;and, returning, put one flower on top of the
tongue, the other underneath. No blood flowed from the penetrated
member. The Hindu stood up, apparently in a trance,
his tongue spiked. The priest again alertly stepped back and
returned with a chicken, snapping the hen's head off as if cut
with a scissors. The blood from the headless fowl was
sprinkled over the convert; then another hen was brought, killed
likewise, its blood also being sprayed over the supplicant, when
the orchestra played. The follower next bended to his knees,
after which the flower cone was lifted on his head. He rose;
then the group, to the accompaniment of the "music," walked
over sand dunes in the direction of a mosque, where, it was
said, the fork would be withdrawn from the inducted Asiatic's
tongue.</p>

<p>The Zulu ricksha puller is the most striking feature of that
interesting city to a visitor, as he proves an object of much
curiosity and admiration. He is in a class by himself. In
stature, he stands from 5 feet 6 inches to 6 feet 4 inches; in
color, darker than a mulatto, but not black; with bare legs,
strong, muscular and fleet of foot; generally ready to smile,
showing his perfect teeth; standing between two shafts by
which he draws the ricksha, watching eagerly for a fare&mdash;this
gives but a meager illustration of the Zulu ricksha puller.</p>

<p>The Zulu reaches the culmination of vanity when he has
fixed himself up to look like, and to imitate the actions of, an
ox, horse or mule, for he has a veneration for these dumb animals.
The larger the horns he can wear, which are secured
to a piece of cloth that fits tight to the head, the better he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
pleased. A number of long feathers often extend from between
the horns, and vari-colored grass and thin reeds, also
attached to the same place, fall to and below the waistline.
Added to this head adornment, calabashes, sometimes as large
as a cantaloupe, protrude from the side of his head. His jacket,
sleeveless, which bears designs of plaids and squares, resembling
a checker-board, extends midway between thigh and knee. His
pants are a slit knickerbocker, also extending to halfway between
thigh and knee, but from the hem fall strips of red braid
six inches below. The pants are split to allow his legs freedom
when drawing the vehicle.</p>

<p>The ricksha puller is eternally trying to think of something
fantastic and grotesque to wear. One fellow may be seen with
his legs and feet painted blue, representing the sky, with white
spots dotted here and there to represent stars, another with
both legs painted white. At times one leg is painted red and
the other white. Also may be seen, fastened to the puller's
horns, the skull of a calf or sheep, or perhaps of a monkey.
Monkey skins, with tails attached, are worn, one in front and
the other on the back. Again, a discarded plug hat may be
hung on one horn and an empty vegetable can on the other
while he is pulling a passenger about the city. Sometimes his
head looks like a small flower garden, as he is seen trundling
his ricksha about with bright red hibiscus and carnations sticking
out of his black, woolly head at the top and from the sides.
At night a small light&mdash;generally a candle&mdash;attached to the
axle of his sulky, may be seen at the sides of streets and showing
from dark alleys or from under a spreading tree. The puller
will jingle the little bell on the shafts of his ricksha to attract
the attention of a passerby. The weird trappings, with the dim
outline of the Zulu, together with his long horns showing from
the darkness, will not inspire confidence in one unfamiliar with
the native puller. In short, he appears fantastically inhuman
by day and grotesquely brutish by night. His physique, however,
is an object of admiration; mentally, he is a child.</p>

<p>The ricksha is a two-wheeled, two-shaft sulky, with rubber
tired wheels, upholstered, and will seat two persons. A hood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
is attached to the seating box like that of a carriage. A small
bell hangs from one of the shafts, which the puller sounds to
give warning of his coming. Under, from the center of the
axle depends a bar of iron with a small wheel at the end. This
bar prevents passengers from falling out if the ricksha should
tip while going up hill. The service is good and the fare cheap&mdash;from
6 to 50 cents&mdash;the different fare stages being printed
on a card. Like every one engaged in similar occupations, the
puller knows a stranger, and succeeds often in getting more
than the just fare from men, but women generally ask for the
schedule card.</p>

<p>"Ricksha!" is the only word shouted when a puller is
wanted. Regular stands for them are located in different parts
of the city, and if one feels depressed in spirits and wishes to
get out of the "dumps," a good way to have the "cloud" lifted
is to shout "Ricksha!" when within 200 to 300 feet from where
fifteen to twenty of the pullers are chatting and waiting for a
fare. Every one of them will spring between the shafts, like
fire horses to harness, and make a dash at full speed to the
person who shouted. The noise and rattle a group of pullers
make in approaching sounds almost like a collision between two
railway trains.</p>

<p>The puller rests the shafts on the ground while his passenger
is being seated. He holds his big, strong, flat foot on the
thills, so the vehicle will not slip while one is getting aboard,
until his patron tells him to go. If one cannot speak the native
language, not a word will be spoken, for rarely does one meet
a native who can speak English. The passenger points his
finger in the direction he wishes to be drawn. The Zulu raises
the shafts and, after a few slow, heavy pulls to get the vehicle
started, one is spinning along as fast as a trolley car travels.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo082" id="illo082"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jim Fish Was the Swiftest Puller that Ever Wore a
Brace of Horns.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Durban, South Africa.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"Jim Fish!" "Jim Fish!" they will call to a passerby, at
the same time ringing the small bell on the shafts, while advancing
and acting in a manner that suggests the person being
approached had forgotten to call a puller. Jim Fish was the
swiftest puller that ever wore a brace of horns. In a three mile
race with a trolley car Jim came out ahead, but, like Pheidippides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the Greek of the dusty past, after whose run the Marathon
has been named, he fell dead when he had crossed the
finish line. By calling out "Jim Fish" the Zulus imagine the
name suggests a fast ride.</p>

<p>The puller appears at his best when traveling down grade.
Just at the head of the decline he jerks the shafts upward&mdash;this
movement bringing his back close to the dashboard&mdash;when
his arms rest akimbo on the thills. He maintains his full height
during this change of position, which is in accordance with professional
ricksha pullers' custom. The sulky naturally tilting
backward&mdash;also the occupants&mdash;his body is nearer the axle
of his vehicle than when traveling over a level or inclined surface.
Aided by the weight of his passengers, the ricksha is
then almost evenly balanced. Riding on the shafts, he throws
to one side, like a jumping-jack, the big leg bearing the painted
design of the sky or openwork, and his unpainted leg to the
other. He also moves his body from side to side and assumes
a labored expression, although resting while being borne on the
shafts. His body movement and stern appearance are affected,
and are, as he believes, in keeping with that of a racehorse when
coming down the home stretch, which he is imitating. His
horns and their adornment, together with the colored grass
streamers, feathers, monkey tails, checkerboard designed jacket,
calabashes, braid, flowers&mdash;all his trappings are then set full
to the wind, as the Zulu seems to actually fly through space.</p>

<p>In stormy weather, which means good business for the puller,
the hood is raised, and a piece of canvas that covers the front of
the ricksha is buttoned to the sides, which protects the occupant
from rain both from above and in front. Off the Zulu goes,
after he has tucked the rug under his passenger's feet and has
seen to it that the canvas shelters his fare. The rain may be
coming down in torrents, and the water half knee deep in the
streets, with the handicap of the raised hood and front canvas
against him; but patter, patter, patter he will continue, watching
for depressions, in order to sidestep them so that his
passenger will not be jolted, until he has reached the place at
which his fare wishes to alight. He will take one home in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
any sort of weather, as his strong legs and body rarely fail
him.</p>

<p>The puller will often have nothing on but the jacket, short,
split-leg pants and trappings. He does not go to his living
quarters&mdash;the ricksha stable&mdash;and get dry clothes, as one
might expect him to do, but trundles his sulky about in the rain
looking for another fare. He pulls a ricksha from two to three
years, when consumption generally claims him as a victim.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred of these stalwart natives were formerly
engaged in this kind of work, but now there are less than a
thousand. The extension of street car lines from time to time
accounts for the decrease.</p>

<p>The rickshas are owned by a company, and 60 cents a day
is paid by the puller for its use. All he makes over 60 cents is
his own. It is said he often earns from $2 to $3 a day, but
there are also days when his fares do not exceed the rent charge.
Most of the pullers work but four days a week.</p>

<p>A "curfew" bell rings at 9 o'clock each evening, and the
only native seen about the streets who is immune from arrest
after that hour is the ricksha puller. After "curfew" a native
carries a pass or a note from his employer, either of which will
save him from being taken to a police station. It is very amusing
at times to watch a Zulu policeman question a native as to
why he is out late. His only protection is the note or his pass,
which the policeman makes pretense at reading, though he does
not know A from B.</p>

<p>This dusky guardian of the peace is next in interest to the
ricksha puller. His uniform is a jacket, dark blue in color,
that reaches just below the waist band. His pants are of the
same material, reaching to and covering the kneecap, where it
is buttoned tight. His legs from his knees down are bare and
shine like polished ebony, for they are oiled every day. He
wears a stingy head piece called a forage cap, generally made of
blue cloth, which covers about one-third of the head&mdash;the side&mdash;from
the arch of the ear to within two inches of the crown.
This is held in place by a string looping under his chin or resting
between the chin and lower lip. Some caps have a red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
stripe across the top, and all have a dent or crease. His weapon
is a knobkerry, a stick an inch round, with a knob on it as large
as a croquet ball. A pair of handcuffs is also included among
this Zulu officer's equipment.</p>

<p>The European policeman of Durban, as many European
women of that city, have an easy job. The native police do
any "rough" work required to subdue black offenders, as Europeans,
to whom the white policeman would give his attention,
are as a rule law abiding. The native carries his superior's
raincoat, overcoat, or any burden that the white officer might
need while on duty. A black policeman is not permitted to
arrest a European, no matter how serious the offense against the
law might be. The worst offenders are Indians; but big thefts,
safe-blowing, house breaking, hold-ups, sand-bagging, etc., are
few, which indicates the respect people have for the law in this
British stronghold. White policemen receive $75 a month, and
natives $15 a month and board. The working time is eight
hours a day, with three shifts.</p>

<p>A large building without an entrance door would appear as
something unusual in Northern cities; and yet one can find such
an oddity in the far Southland. The one in question is built
of brick, three stories in height, and contains a hundred furnished
rooms. The entrance is a high archway, and just inside
is an elevator and stairway. It is an English custom to leave
one's shoes outside his room door on going to bed, so that
"boots" can polish them in the morning. In front of each
room, on each side of the aisles, in this hostelry could often be
seen from one to four pairs of shoes, yet every pair would be
found in the morning where they had been placed the night before,
although no porter guards the entrance of the building nor
a night watchman the interior.</p>

<p>Meat is about the same price in South Africa as in America.
Beef, mutton, chicken and pork cannot be had for less than
15 to 25 cents a pound. Irish potatoes are expensive, as most
of this standby is imported. Eggs sell at 35 to 60 cents a
dozen. Apples are imported from Australia and Canada.</p>

<p>Pineapples, oranges and bananas are found on the table of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
nearly every household the year round. Then there are, among
other varieties of seasonable fruit, the mango, guava, grenadilla
and avacada pear. The pineapple, when picked ripe, is as soft
as our pear. These native fruits sell at a reasonable figure. A
hundred bananas can often be bought for six cents.</p>

<p>Hotel expenses are reasonable, $2 a day insuring good accommodation.
In boarding houses, good board and lodging can be
had at from $30 to $35 a month. Splendid furnished rooms
can be rented at from $10 to $15 a month. Meals in popular
priced restaurants cost 30 and 35 cents.</p>

<p>The sun rises from the Indian Ocean here and travels during
the day on an almost straight course, shining on the south side
of the street, the north side being partly shaded. For this
reason the principal business street of Durban is roofed on the
south side, as it is exposed to the sun from morning until sunset.
The cold and warm winds also come from a different
direction than those above the equator&mdash;the warm winds from
the north and the cold winds from the south. Even the sun
seems to rise in the west and set in the east.</p>

<p>Wages paid mechanics range from $3 to $4 a day of eight
hours' work. Such employment as teamster, hod carrier, street
laborer, 'longshoreman, and park worker is all done by Indians
and natives. The native is paid from 25 to 50 cents a day, the
latter figure being considered good wages, while the Indian
works for 10 to 15 cents a day. Hotel work, waiting on
tables, kitchen work, and even cooking, with a few exceptions,
is done by blacks, chiefly Indians.</p>

<p>A white man "on his uppers" in Durban, or in any black
center, for that part, is to be pitied. If he be a mechanic, his
chances for work are none too good, and if he be an unskilled
worker there is no chance for him at all, as blacks do all the
work of that sort. The United States and Canada are the only
countries&mdash;possibly Mexico, too&mdash;in which one can travel on
railroad trains without paying fare or being put into a penitentiary.
Walking on a railway track in Europe is a prison
offense. So, taking that as one's cue, a man caught stealing a
ride on a train might be tried for treason. As Durban is 7,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
miles from England, 4,500 miles from the Argentine, 6,000
miles from Australia and 5,000 from India, a fellow "broke"
in the coast cities of South Africa is in a sorrowful plight. The
cheapest steamship passage from South African ports to England
is $80 to $100.</p>

<p>Labor unions exist in South Africa, and the members take
an active part in politics. Not long since a spirited campaign
was on for a seat in the Senate. One of the foremost business
men of that country was a candidate for the office, and a union
labor man, a locomotive engineer by trade, was the opposing
candidate. The lines were tightly drawn between capital and
labor in that senatorial contest. The "one-man-one-vote"
clause has yet to be drafted into the constitution of the Union
of South Africa. Only a citizen paying a certain amount of
tax during the year is allowed to vote. On the other hand, a
man holding much property, and this scattered about the country,
can, as in England, vote in as many districts as his property
is located. A wealthy man may cast half a dozen votes at an
election, while the workingman taxpayer will not, as a rule,
have more than one vote. The capitalist candidate for the
Senate in this election had four votes to cast, while the railroad
man had but one. A widely known man from the Transvaal
was imported to Natal to do "heavy work" for the wealthy
candidate, and prominent labor men from the Transvaal and
the Cape of Good Hope Provinces were saying and doing all
they could to make votes for their candidate.</p>

<p>"We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang
separately," a labor campaigner was heard to say at one gathering,
quoting Benjamin Franklin's cynical epigram. "Of the
people, by the people, and for the people," Abraham Lincoln's
immortal words, were also used during the campaign. But
the speakers of both parties were tyros compared to the American
brand of spellbinder. Election day came, and he who had
plural votes cast them, and he who had one vote cast it. The
result of an election is made known by a judge announcing the
figures from the balcony of the Town Hall. "Hear, ye!
Hear ye!" a voice was heard to command, the judge addressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the people assembled. The engineer had 36 more votes than
his wealthy competitor, and was the third labor legislator elected
to the South African Upper House.</p>

<p>Every mechanic has his "boy"&mdash;the bricklayer, carpenter,
plumber, electrician, painter&mdash;to wait on him. One might be
located in the black belt for years and not see a mechanic carry
even a pair of overalls. A mechanic may be seen any time,
when working, asking his "boy" to hand a tool that would not
be two inches beyond his natural reach. A bricklayer becomes
so painfully helpless that he will neither stoop nor reach for a
brick; that is what his "boy" is for. The carpenter must
saw boards, because the native cannot saw straight, but in every
other respect he is just as helpless as the bricklayer. Clerks
even have a "boy" to hand a pen or any other thing they
might need in connection with their work. The only tradesman
observed who did his work without the aid of a "boy"
was the printer and linotype operator. And what applies to
printers may be said of editors and others engaged in the printing
trade. They really work in the old-fashioned way. Were
one to take a spade in hand to prepare the garden for vegetables,
merely that act of manual labor would be very apt to prove a
bar to a further continuance of the respect of his European
neighbors, and assuredly so by the natives and Indians.</p>

<p>The white man is always at his minimum energy where the
black man is depended on to do the work. We need not go
farther than our Southern States to learn that lesson.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, discovered the Province
of Natal five years after Columbus set foot on the North
American Continent. Da Gama's first visit to Natal was on
Christmas Day in the year 1497. As Christmas Day is the natal
day of the Savior, and as the word natal in the Spanish and
Portuguese languages is used as is the word birth in the English
language, this will explain the origin of the naming of
Natal.</p>

<p>For more than three hundred years that section of South
Africa remained as Da Gama found it before white men made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
a settlement among the Zulus. In 1824 a few Englishmen
built temporary dwelling places on the shores of the Indian
Ocean, more Englishmen joining them from time to time, until
Durban has become one of the leading seaport cities of the
African continent. The coast section of the Province of Natal
is the only part of South Africa in which the Dutch were not
the pioneers.</p>

<p>A great many humpback whales inhabit the Indian Ocean
in the stretch of sea, nearly a thousand miles long, separating
Durban from Capetown. Of late years whales have been
hunted on a large scale, and each season finds a new whaling
company in the field to share in the profits of this lucrative industry.
Eight or ten factories, or stations, most of these located
a few miles from Durban, are now engaged in utilizing the by-products
of the whale.</p>

<p>Harpooning whales, or whaling&mdash;to use the general term&mdash;is
engaged in at places separated by thousands of nautical
miles, and, like other water industries, has its season. Whales,
like wild fowl, migrate at certain seasons to some particular
part of the great water expanse, and return again the succeeding
year. By nature, this cetacean prefers a cold climate to a
warm one. The season for their migration is at a different
period to that of the wild fowl, for the "spouter" leaves the
zone of the hot sun and swims great distances until he reaches
cooler water. Sometimes it is from the North Atlantic to the
South Atlantic or Indian Oceans, and at others from the Indian
Ocean southeasterly to the South Pacific Ocean, the water of
which is cooled by the icebergs of the South Pole section.
Whales leaving the North Atlantic in early summer for the
South Atlantic Ocean know it is cooler south of the equator
than north of it.</p>

<p>Americans and Norwegians engaged early in the whaling
business in the North Atlantic Ocean, and up to a few years
ago American whaling ships made frequent visits to the South
Atlantic and Indian Oceans in quest of the oil-producing leviathan.
But it is to the Norwegian that credit must be given for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
building up the whaling industry in the Indian Ocean, thereby
putting in circulation a large sum of money each season that,
until recent years, had been overlooked.</p>

<p>From 600 to 800 of these monsters of the deep are harpooned
and rendered into oil in the Durban factories in a season&mdash;from
June to November, inclusive&mdash;the cool season in that
part of the world. Thirty tons is the average weight of whales
killed in the Indian Ocean. Those on exhibition in museums
give one some idea of the size of a whale, yet the cured specimen
is a poor substitute for one which had been "spouting" an
hour before.</p>

<p>Whaling boats are little larger than a big tug-boat. The
whaler is equipped with one mast, and twenty feet above the
deck a long barrel is secured to this, in which one of the crew
is stationed when hunting the great monster of the sea. The
barrel is called the "crow's nest," and from here the "lookout"
scans the ocean in every direction for the "spouting" mammoth.
On the bow of the boat a cannon is secured, out of
which a harpoon is shot into the whale. The harpoon looks
like a small boat anchor. The length of the harpoon bar is
four feet, and at one end are four hooks ten inches long. The
hooks are attached to the bar by a spring, and, before being
used, are bent down to the bar, and kept in this position by
strong cord. Over the end of the bar fits a spear-pointed cap
a foot long, and in this cap has been placed a dynamite bomb.
Whales are shot within thirty yards of the boat&mdash;sometimes
twenty feet. The cannon can be adjusted to any angle. When
the spear-pointed cap enters the whale, the bomb explodes,
snapping in two the cord with which the four hooks were tied
to the bar, when the hooks spring outward&mdash;like an open umbrella&mdash;inside
the whale.</p>

<p>The vital spot aimed at is the lungs. If the aim proves true,
the large mammal falls a victim to the ugly weapon, and dies
instantly. If the harpoon goes wide, the whale heads for the
bottom. A long, strong rope is secured to one end of the harpoon
bar, and the whale is given liberal latitude for his deluded
effort to escape. Soon the rope slackens, when the whaler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
knows the "spouter" is coming to the surface to breathe. In
the meantime, another harpoon has been placed in the cannon,
and when the whale appears this one is shot into the crippled
monster, putting an end to his fight for life. It sometimes
occurs, however, that the whale breaks the rope fastened to the
eye of the harpoon, when he escapes, carrying the treacherous
weapon in his ponderous frame.</p>

<p>When dead, the great "catch" is drawn to the side of the
boat by the rope secured to the harpoon. His tail flippers,
which are from 10 to 12 feet long, are cut off, to allow of convenient
handling of the cumbersome carcass. A chain is then
put around his delimbed tail, the winches revolve, and, when
his tail has been drawn up close to the bow of the boat, a start
is made for the wharf, leaving behind a wake of red sea, discolored
by the blood running out of his mouth and from the
rent in his body where the harpoon entered.</p>

<p>At the wharf, the boat chain is loosened and the harpoon rope
cut. A chain from the shore is next wound round his tail, a
signal given the engineer to start the machinery, and the great
cetacean is slowly drawn up a slipway out of the water. When
drawn to the head of the slipway, the body continues moving
on to a wide flat car, the railway track on which the car rests
being sunk to a depth level with the top of the slipway. One
flat car is not long enough to afford room for the huge wanderer
of the deep, and a portion is drawn on to a second car.
An engine backs down, is coupled to the "whale train," and
a start made for the factory. The harpoon remains in the
whale until the body is cut to pieces.</p>

<p>At the factory, the whale is drawn off the car on to the
"dissecting" platform by another chain secured to the tail.
Men, with long-handled knives, then make deep cuts&mdash;one in
its back and another in the underpart&mdash;from the point of the
jaw to the tail, and another deep cut the full length of the
carcass. The spaces between these incisions are three feet at
the underpart and from five to six feet on the back. This part
of the process is called "flencing." At the point of the jaw
a piece of flesh is cut until it is released from the bone, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
small hole is cut out of the released part. A kafir, bare-headed
and bare-footed, brings a chain, and the hook of it is put through
the hole made in the released end of flesh at the whale's jaw.
A signal being given a man at the winches to start, the piece of
released hide begins to peel from the jaw, then down to the
shoulder, and further still. When the winches stop, a slab of
hide 40 to 50 feet long, six feet wide, and six inches thick&mdash;from
the point of the jaw to the whale's tail&mdash;is stretched out
on the platform inside up. The skin from the back and sides
of the whale peels off almost as smoothly as does the skin of a
banana from that fruit. The skin at the underpart, however,
does not peel so freely, requiring cutting of the flesh by the
flencer in a similar way to that of severing threads when ripping
a seam in a garment. The underpart of the hide is but
three inches thick. These slabs or strips of flesh, of which six
or seven are procured from a whale, is the blubber, and from
the blubber comes the best grade of oil.</p>

<p>Kafirs, with long-handled knives, cut chunks&mdash;about 18
inches long and 12 inches wide&mdash;from the slabs, which are
thrown into a hopper in which are revolving knives, these cutting
the flesh into small pieces, which drop into elevator buckets,
later emptying into boiling tanks located on a floor above. In
these vats the oil is boiled out of the blubber.</p>

<p>The whalebone, located in the enormous mouth, is yet to be
removed. The flesh to which the bone grows is cut with long,
strong knives around the inside of the jaw. A point of the
flesh is released, a chain hooked to it, the winches again start
revolving, and the whalebone begins peeling off the inside of
the mouth as freely as did the blubber off the back. Half of
the whalebone still remains in the mouth, and this is removed in
the same manner as the first half.</p>

<p>A great blood-red hulk is all that now remains of the whale.
A chain is again wound about and secured to the tail of the
carcass, the winches, for the last time, revolve, when the colossal
frame is moved up an incline to a floor above the platform
on which it was skinned. Then kafirs, with axes, begin cutting
the hulk to pieces, which are thrown into rendering vats. Different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
parts of the body are thrown into different tanks, as
certain portions of the flesh produce a better grade of oil than
other parts. The only portion not boiled is the bone in the
mouth. The blood is the only particle not utilized, and it
would add proportionately to the whale's value were it shed
on shore instead of in the sea. The flesh, after the oil has been
boiled out, is sold to farmers for fertilizing purposes. Thirty
to thirty-five men take part in disposing of a whale at the factory,
and from four to five hours' time is required to get the
carcass into the rendering vats.</p>

<p>From $700 to $800 is the value of a humpback to the manufacturer.
The average quantity of oil rendered is 50 barrels,
and a barrel of oil sells at $12 to $15. Most of the oil from
the Durban factories is shipped to Glasgow, Scotland, the whalebone
to Paris, France.</p>

<p>Some whalers say the food of a whale is small fish, while
other authorities give it, owing to the gullet of some species of
these cetaceans being but two and three inches wide, as very
small, nutritious marine organisms, or insects, many not visible
to the eye, called invertebrates. When feeding, the whale
takes great mouthfuls of water, its whalebone serving as a
strainer and repository in which the minute sea denizens lodge.
The water is then forced out of the mouth, the food extricated
from the meshes of the whalebone and advanced to the throat.
The mouth is so well protected with this bone, which looks like
a low, dense brush thicket, that nothing can enter the throat
until it has proved palatable.</p>

<p>The whale breathes through two slits, 18 inches long, located
on top of the head. Forty-five minutes is as long as the great
mammal can remain under water without breathing; but when
swimming fast it will be seen spouting at intervals of from five
to seven minutes. The spouting is caused by the slits or air-holes
being slightly under the surface. The tube through which
air passes to the lungs is said to be three inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The color of the back and sides is black and the skin smooth.
The underpart of the body and flippers is white, save for an
occasional black speck and fine black lines&mdash;mottled. Flutes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
four inches deep, corrugate the beast's underpart from tail to
neck. In these grooves are to be seen a great many small
barnacles, and on the neck and lower jaw barnacles grow as
large as goose eggs.</p>

<p>From $8,000 to $10,000 is the value of a ton of whalebone
from a "right" whale, 800 to 1,000 pounds of this elastic substance
coming from the mouth. The bone grows in the form
of strips, from 6 to 10 feet in length, and 6 to 12 inches in
width. One end of a strip is fringed with fine, black hair-fiber,
this part of the whale finding its way to the top of persons'
heads, as out of it some "human-hair" wigs are made. A
"right" whale, 10 to 15 feet longer than a humpback and in
value equivalent to eight of the latter, is worth from $5,000 to
$7,000, but of the hundreds killed in the Indian Ocean during
a season not more than half a dozen of this specie will be among
the number. The whalebone from the humpback is in little
demand, growing but two feet long, and is of inferior quality.
The bone in the mouth of the "right" whale calf&mdash;strips a
foot long and tender&mdash;is of great value. These are shredded,
the fine, soft fiber being made into artists' painting brushes.</p>

<p>The cow whale brings forth young each year, but triplets
or even twins are unknown in the cetacean family. A calf
first opens its eyes in the sea and soon finds its way to its
mother's side, where, securely snuggled by a strong fin, it remains
from three to six days. When able to "paddle its own
canoe," the baby whale&mdash;a born swimmer&mdash;keeps close to its
mother's side, either up to the surface to "blow," adding a
tiny whitecap to the bounding main, or to accompany its maternal
guardian to feed in salty pastures of the deep. A whale
calf nurses like a colt. When a nursing cow whale is harpooned,
whalers generally kill the calf also, as it would starve
if left without its mother's nourishment.</p>

<p>At certain times of the year whales move in pairs&mdash;male
and female. When a hunter meets a couple the female is first
selected for slaughter; the sex is known by the cow being
larger. The male whale will not desert his dead mate, and
thus becomes an easy victim of the hunter's harpoon. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
other hand, if the male be shot, the female immediately takes
flight.</p>

<p>A whale is 17 feet long when born. At three years of age
it has attained a length of 30 feet, and during the succeeding
eight or nine years reaches its full length&mdash;from 45 to 50
feet; so that it requires ten to twelve years to reach its maximum
size. Old whalers are loth to hazard a statement concerning
the natural lifetime of the cetacean.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>Zululand was next visited. During the reign of their
kings Zulus controlled their own internal affairs&mdash;made their
own laws, apportioned the land, chastised their subjects, conferred
with British officials concerning border line rules&mdash;were,
in fact, in every sense, a distinct, unfettered race of people.
Zululand was Zululand then. War after war, with
gatling guns and modern fighting implements pitted against
their mediæval arms&mdash;the assegai, or spear&mdash;naturally made
the tribe submissive and wiped out their border line. So long
as they had a king there was always danger of trouble from
Zululand. Dinizulu, the last ruler, was taken prisoner, and
was "boarded" in a Transvaal penitentiary until a few years
ago, when he died. The border line between Natal and Zululand
passed away, and the interests of the Zulus and the affairs
of Zululand are now looked after and administered by
officials of the Province of Natal.</p>

<p>The train, passing through cuts and grades, is half embowered
with flowering trees, growing on the banks. The giant bamboo,
in obedience to a summery wind, was gracefully swaying to
and fro; the aloe, with its flowery top, sixteen feet above the
ground, sentinel-like, contributed its share to the floral ensemble,
and, together with an almost endless tract of soft, light
green sugar-cane growing on each side of the railroad track,
offered a mellow landscape found in but few parts of the
world.</p>

<p>A depressing contrast to nature&mdash;the Indian coolie scourge&mdash;is
witnessed at every stopping place in this part. We were
in the sugar growing section of Natal, and, as mentioned previously,
Indian coolies are employed entirely in this industry.
There they were by hundreds, most of them of objectionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
appearance, and a dirty, almost naked, baby astraddle every
woman's hip, the Hindu mother's custom of carrying her child.</p>

<p>We reached the Tugela River, the border line between Natal
and Zululand, and, thirty miles further, the train stopped at
Ginginhlovu, our destination. Ginginhlovu (elephant, in
Zulu) was 93 miles from where we started, and the train was
seven hours running that distance, running to schedule, too.
Indian shanty stores were pleasantly absent, as none but white
traders are allowed to do business in Zululand.</p>

<p>The post cart is the stage coach of South Africa. Strongly
built, it is covered with canvas, has two wide wheels and contains
two seats. A seat will accommodate three persons in a
pinch&mdash;the maximum capacity of the coach being five passengers
and the driver&mdash;but as the latter usually takes up two-thirds
of the front seat to handle the large team required to
draw the coach, the ordinary capacity of the cart is four passengers,
three occupying the rear and one the front seat. A
frame at the back serves for luggage, and small hand baggage
may be put under the seats. Four or six mules comprise a cart
team, the charge being ten cents a mile.</p>

<p>We left the railroad, and our mode of travel into the interior
of Zululand was by cart, wagon&mdash;a conveyance drawn
by beasts. Five passengers, the maximum number, squeezed
themselves into the cart. The next trip inland was on the following
day, for which we would have to wait, the station-master
had informed us, "unless there was a transport going to
Eshowe." Eventually a transport&mdash;a truck 18 feet long&mdash;was
found, the driver of which said he thought he had room for
another passenger. The transport, ridged with bags of cornmeal
five feet high, was drawn by four teams of mules.</p>

<p>"Climb on," said the driver to a group of six; "we'll be
starting in a few minutes." Three women, two men and a
boy began to scale the transport up to the top of the load.
"Get up," said the driver to the mules, when a start was made
for the interior of Zululand, the passengers sitting on the top
tier of cornmeal bags of the loaded African transport.</p>

<p>We traveled slowly seventeen miles over a good macadam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
road. "That's the home of Dinizulu, the Zulu king," said the
boy passenger, as we passed a frame building close to the road.
We reached our destination just at sundown&mdash;Eshowe, the
old capital of Zululand, and one of the prettiest places visited
in South Africa.</p>

<p>Shade trees, flowers, comfortable homes built in spacious
yards; small, but substantial, public buildings; a good library,
a wooded glen just away from the town, in which had been
built a splendid cement swimming pool, give an insight into
what the old Zulu capital looks like now. The comfortable
appearance of Eshowe has been made by the European. English
and native weekly papers are printed here, and the quality
of the work is good.</p>

<p>A European boy volunteered to show me about town. He
had taken me to the swimming pool, and as we were passing
through a timbered portion of this natural park he suddenly
shouted, "Look out!" He then pointed to a big fly that had
just passed between us. "If that fly had struck you the bitten
part would swell up as large as a hen's egg. Often the effects
of the bite will assume the nature of an ulcer," he added. A
great number of flies in South Africa draw blood when they
strike a victim, whether man or beast.</p>

<p>We had 35 miles more to travel before our last stop in Zululand
would be reached. The post cart left at five o'clock in
the morning, with four passengers, and was drawn by four
mules. The road was level for the most part, with high grass
growing on each side, broken only by an occasional giraffe
thorn or mimosa tree. The mimosa was in flower, and so
much fragrance was diffused from the thorn tree that one
would know of its existence if it were not in sight a hundred
feet away.</p>

<p>"Hello, Graham!" shouted one of the passengers to a white
man who stood in the door of a building at which we had
pulled up. We had reached N'Halini, the first relay, where
we breakfasted. "Hello! everybody," returned Graham, for
he proved to be the proprietor of the eating station. "I haven't
any eggs to serve you this morning, but I'm strong on steak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
ham and bacon. Bring out a big piece of steak to make up for
the eggs," he directed one of his Zulu boys.</p>

<p>Graham is a sailor with a wooden leg. He entertained us
by telling how many times he had been caught in the net fastened
to the boom of a sailing ship&mdash;a "wind-jammer," as he
termed that style of craft&mdash;and how, when encountering the
fierce gales that blow in the Straits of Magellan, he had been
blown entirely off his feet, his body being lifted in mid-air, his
legs suggestive of ribbons, while holding to a deck rail.</p>

<p>"Did you get enough to eat?" he asked, when we had
finished. And we admitted we had. Graham had two pigs
eaten by crocodiles the day before, and he could not restrain
himself from bemoaning his luck.</p>

<p>"So long, fellows! I'll have eggs for you when you come
back. So long!" were the parting words of the onetime
sailor, as, with an additional team of mules, we started on our
second relay.</p>

<p>"Sit forward, please, while we are going up this seven-mile
hill; the cart is tilting back too much," said the driver. We
had five passengers now, as another one had got on at Graham's
place. It's easier to say Graham's place than it is to try to
pronounce the Zulu name.</p>

<p>On, on we traveled over those beautiful hills of Zululand,
the passengers chatting as we moved along. Grassy hills, 500
feet high, bare of timber and even shrubbery, with native huts
built on the sides, and small patches of corn growing here and
there, proved of interest. Vultures were flying high up in the
air, bevies of guinea fowl scurried to cover, and the wagtail,
a black and white bird of swallow size, with a tail ten inches
long, crossed the roadway from time to time. We had been
told of the beauty of Zululand, and nothing had been exaggerated.</p>

<p>Grass&mdash;long and short&mdash;was growing everywhere, enough
to feed millions of cattle, and not a "critter" grazing in sight.
The Zulus, before and for some years after the white man
settled in South Africa, were a wealthy tribe. Hundreds of
thousands of cattle, sheep and goats roamed over and fed off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
these ever-grassy hills; but tick fever&mdash;East Coast fever, it is
as often called&mdash;had fattened the vultures and made the Zulu
poor.</p>

<p>We reached the second relay, then the third, but the beauty
of landscape did not diminish. Our next relay will be the end
of our stage journey&mdash;Melmoth&mdash;52 miles from the railroad.</p>

<p>"The stopping off place" is a term often heard, but when
one reaches a point where there is no railroad and the terminus
only of post carts, it is certainly the stopping off place. Europeans
live in remote places still beyond Melmoth, and their
mail is brought to them by native postmen on foot.</p>

<p>We reached our destination early in the afternoon. Mail
for persons living beyond "the stopping off place," brought
with us in the cart, was to start on its way at three o'clock.
As it was a week before Christmas, the post contained a great
number of Christmas presents. The mail finally being sorted,
it was entrusted to the postman's care. All the letters could
be put in a coat pocket, but the presents strapped to his body
made a heavy load.</p>

<p>A Zulu, six feet tall, stood on the porch of the squatty postoffice
building, looking like an off-colored Santa Claus. Having
reached for a stick a foot longer than his height, he stood
up straight, waiting for the word to go.</p>

<p>"All right, Jim," the postmaster ordered in the native tongue.
"Ba, ba," returned the negro in a low voice, bowing and saluting,
with one hand raised to the side of his head. He turned
round quickly and walked alertly in the direction where white
people live, to be made happy by presents sent to them by
friends living in distant lands. Thirty-three miles was the
distance the Zulu carried the mail. It was three o'clock in
the afternoon when he left the Melmoth post office, and was
due at the next post station at 9:30 the morning following.</p>

<p>"He'll be there on the minute," the postmaster replied to
a question as to whether the carrier could travel the distance
in the time allotted, considering the heavy load. "He never
fails us. Always on time&mdash;in hail, rain or shine," he concluded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Zulu huts are round, the framework being of poles bent
half circular, tied with grass rope. The arch poles are supported
with bent poles strung crosswise, these being made secure
by grass rope. Roof and sides are covered with grass and
reeds, secured to the framework with the same kind of rope.
The floor is of soil, generally taken from an ant-hill, and becomes
as compact as cement. In the center of the hut, what
may be termed a sort of earthen vessel is built, sometimes 18
inches across, and this is the cooking place&mdash;the stove. Zulus
build good huts. No windows are provided, however, and but
one low entrance. The cooking utensils are limited to an
iron kettle, with three legs. This is placed in the "stove."
Cornmeal (called mealy meal) is the chief food, which is
boiled in the three-legged kettle, and, when cooked, the family
gathers round it, some sitting on the floor and others resting
on their haunches. Each member is supplied with a wooden
spoon, and with these they eat mealy meal as long as there is
any to be eaten. A ladle to stir the mush, cut out of a calabash,
is generally seen in a Zulu home. The bed is a cotton
blanket, spread on the earthen floor, and a bowed piece of wood,
resting on two upright pieces at each end, about four inches
high, serves as a pillow. A soap box may occasionally be found
in a hut, but no chairs. The interior is generally black with
smoke from the "stove," a strong, sooty odor being noticeable.</p>

<p>The Zulu tribe does not "colonize"&mdash;or, rather, assemble
in villages, as each family live by themselves. Huts are numerous,
of course, but one rarely, if ever, finds a settlement&mdash;a
town. They live in "kraals." A kraal is a group of huts,
numbering from two to ten, surrounded by a fence, generally
composed of thorn brush. The collection of huts generally
indicates the number of wives that that Zulu has. One hut is
always larger than the others, this being occupied by the first
wife. Where cattle are kept together in a small area inclosed
by a fence, it becomes a cattle kraal. Sometimes one kraal
serves as a shelter for both natives and cattle.</p>

<p>Polygamy is common. The method of obtaining a wife is
by purchase from the father. Cattle is the medium of barter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
from 10 to 80 cows being the number asked for each girl. A
wife who can be bought for 10 cows is just the ordinary girl.
The daughter of a petty chief would bring 20 cows, and a
girl of royal descent could not be purchased for less than 70
to 100 cows.</p>

<p>When a Zulu wishes to marry he comes to an understanding
with the girl's father concerning the number of cattle that must
be paid for the bride, and he must not forget to include among
them another nice beast, which is slaughtered and eaten at the
wedding feast. The marriage always takes place at the home
of the bridegroom. The bride, with her attendants, arrives the
evening before the wedding day. The extra ox is killed early
in the morning.</p>

<p>The bride wears a veil of beads over her face for several
hours while the ceremony is taking place. Certain persons are
appointed to celebrate the marriage. Dancing is indulged in
during this period. The father of the bride steps forward
among the merrymakers and bespeaks the merits of his daughter.
An old woman runs backward and forward among the guests,
holding in her hand a small stick, pointing upward, and cackling
like a hen. Dancing is going on all the time, one "group"
of dancers holding the "stage" until exhausted, when another
group will fill the vacated space and inject renewed life into the
ceremony.</p>

<p>The bridegroom must show his valor during the pow-wow.
He steps into the arena with two sticks in his hand&mdash;stout
walking-sticks. A series of thrusts, feints, dodges, ducking,
then a terrible thrust; more fencing, another awful jab; snorting,
sweating, uttering deep grunts of satisfaction; stamping
his feet heavily on the ground to make a noise, imitating thunder,
which denotes powerfulness&mdash;he is fighting an imaginary
foe, and when the bride's father and wedding party signify by
applause that he has been victorious&mdash;that he has killed his
adversary in mortal combat&mdash;he retires, carrying in his bosom
the assurance that he is a Zulu warrior "to the manner born."</p>

<p>From 300 to 400 Zulus attend a wedding, which lasts sometimes
several days. Native beer, made from corn, is brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in large quantities in hollow calabashes by the guests. Faction
fights, often brought about through uninvited onlookers, but
generally from drinking too much beer, frequently prove an
exciting feature of a Zulu wedding.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances can a wife leave her husband. A
bargain is a bargain with the Zulu. On the other hand, if the
bride's merits have been misrepresented, her husband will take
her to her father's kraal and demand the return of the cattle
he paid for her. Though the girl gets the cattle in name, the
father really has the cows.</p>

<p>When a husband dies, his wives are not left alone in the
world. It is a Zulu custom that a brother of the deceased look
after the widows. It may seem an imposition on a brother to
be saddled with two large families&mdash;his own and his dead
brother's&mdash;yet, bearing in mind that the widows, collectively,
are mothers of half a dozen to fifteen daughters, it means that
the guardian would fall heir to a nice herd of cows when the
girls reach womanhood. Zulu families, however, are not large,
averaging about five children.</p>

<p>A Zulu's standing with his people is based on the number of
wives he has. One with six to nine helpmates is considered in
good circumstances. In a general sense, the wives get along
agreeably when they number from two to six. The first wife
is mistress of those who come after her. Under the king's
ruling, putting to death a favorite wife by the others occurred
from time to time; but in such instances the wives numbered
eight to twelve. Murders of this character have become of
rare occurrence, however, since Zululand has been governed by
the white man.</p>

<p>Wives and children are of little or no expense to a husband.
He does not work after he has become the possessor of several
wives, and the corn is planted, hoed, husked and ground into
mealy meal by the wives. None of them wear shoes, nor
hats, nor coats. Cotton blankets, which cost from 25 to 35
cents, are their chief covering. No money is required for
baby carriages, as, when they are not snugly dished in a blanket
on the mother's back, with the ends tied in front across her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
chest, they are seen creeping about the kraalyard. A visit to
the country districts will find native women hoeing or working
at something else with their babes tied to their back. Their
husbands are in their huts, smoking pipes or sleeping. Zulu
women look as strong as the men. Save for their babes, all
burdens are borne on their heads. This mode of bearing weight
is often carried to the ridiculous. A spool of thread, a tomato,
a tincup or similar light article may be seen balanced on a
woman's head. But she will carry in the same way, with as
apparent ease, though, a 100-pound bag of cornmeal, a five
gallon tin of water, a big three-legged iron kettle, and other
weights that would tax the strength of a strong man. The
Zulu woman's superior physique is accounted for, to a large
degree, by the bearing of burdens on her head from early childhood.</p>

<p>A Zulu woman "dressed up" is a striking figure. An ocher-colored
cone of hair rises from her head sometimes as high as
10 inches. One unfamiliar with the native's hair, as seen resting
flat on the head, would never imagine the kinky mop, when
straightened, would measure from 12 to 18 inches, but it will.
The natural color of the hair, of course, is black, and its unnatural
color is brought about by the application of a thin, red-mud
solution. Grass stalks, placed inside, form a frame, which
keeps the cone from settling. At the bottom, a band, generally
a strip of hide, keeps the "ornament" firm. A long hat pin,
whittled thin from a large bone of a beast, also plays a part
in keeping the "stove-pipe" properly poised. Her face is
broad and rather masculine, the expression stoical. No head
covering is worn, and weights are borne on women's heads,
cone or no cone. Her broad, strong shoulders are generally
bare, and she always stands straight. Strings are fastened
around her neck&mdash;sometimes these are hairs from an elephant's
tail&mdash;to which are attached square pieces of cloth, with colored
beads fastened on them, resembling dominos. Generally
wire bangles are worn on one arm, these in some instances
being so numerous that they cover the arm from wrist to elbow.
Often the skin of a calf or a sheep or that of a wild beast is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
wrapped around her chest, passing under her arms, and fastened
at the back. This "waist" extends in front to about the
knees, and sometimes it is ornamented with beads, pebbles or
small seashells. A short skirt of rough cloth extends to just
below the knees, so that her legs from that point are bare, as
precious few native women wear shoes. They have none.
Only married women, or women engaged to be married, appear
in the cone-shaped hair fashion.</p>

<p>Polygamy is conducive to thrift as well as to laziness. Nowadays
few cattle are left to sons by fathers, as tick fever has
almost bared the country of this means of food and barter.
So, in order to get a wife, a Zulu must earn money with which
to buy cows. The umfaan will save half of his wages of
$2.50 or $3 a month that he receives as houseboy. When he
has saved enough to buy a cow&mdash;they can be had for $15&mdash;it
is put to graze close to his father's kraal, and he will save
enough money to buy another cow or two. In the meantime
calves are grazing, and by the time he has reached 21 years of
age he generally has enough cows to buy one wife. Numbers
of young men go to the Kimberley and Transvaal mines, where
the wages run from $15 to $30 a month, with board. Unlike
the American negro, the Zulu saves his money. But he will
not work more than six months in the year at most. It is said
a great deal of the Zulu's cash savings is hid in the ground.
They are suspicious of the stability of banks, so keep the money
where they can see it when they wish to.</p>

<p>The native of South Africa is as independent of the white
man's aid to-day as he was a thousand years ago. His wants
being so few, and his food easily obtained, he is not compelled
to work for the white man. He is not ambitious for riches.</p>

<p>When a Zulu's hut is built on government ground the tax
per year is $3.50, which includes all the land he feels disposed
to work. He does not plant all his corn in one field, but has
two or three patches growing not far from the kraal. If his
hut is built on private land, the landowner charges the native
from $5 to $10 a year rent. Land for cultivation, however,
is included in the rent of the private landowner. Some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
public men of South Africa entertain the belief that if a
heavier government tax were imposed on the native it would
force him to work more&mdash;smoke him out, as it were. Just
think of the snug income some Europeans who have from 100
to 300 huts on their undeveloped land are receiving from natives,
as they collect from $5 to $10 for each hut. The native
still pays the $3.50 government tax also. While Zulus as a
race are honest, few Europeans will do business with them on
a credit basis; they must pay cash for what they buy.</p>

<p>Honesty among Zulu house servants is an admirable trait.
One might place a bushel of $20 gold pieces in the center of a
room, be away from home for months, and on return find the
money where it had been left. This applies more to what is
termed a "raw kafir." When they have been among white
people for a year or two their traits of honesty often slacken.
The black man, as a rule, will pick up all the white man's
vices, but few of his virtues.</p>

<p>A violation of the Zulu code of honesty was formerly punishable
by death, and in some cases is still adhered to. The
theft of a horse, cow, sheep, goat, pig or dog brought the death
penalty. The moral code is inflexible. If a girl leaves a
kraal to go into service in the towns and returns not as good
as she was when she left the hut, she is likely to disappear
mysteriously. A native guilty of committing a crime with a
Zulu woman may be put to death.</p>

<p>Few deformed or crippled members of this tribe are seen.
Under the kings' ruling an imperfect child at birth was not
permitted to live.</p>

<p>Respect for old age is another excellent trait of the Zulu
tribe. Were a mother or father to be living with a son and
his wives, the father is "boss" of the kraal; and were the
father to die the mother is the head of the kraal. The elder
of two persons is respected by the younger. The oldest son
has absolute rule over the other children; but, if the father be
a chief, the youngest son succeeds him. Indian-like, Zulus
walk in single file, and the younger always walks behind the
elder. The woman always walks behind the man and carries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
his belongings. A Zulu woman is never seen alone&mdash;always
with a child, woman, or girl.</p>

<p>Zulus have their own name for Europeans. A man who
wore spectacles would be "four-eyed" in their language; a
person with a scar on his face or hands, would be "scar" in
the native language; one having a deep voice or light voice&mdash;that
would be his name with the native. Long hair, short
hair, mustache, a smooth face&mdash;any mark or peculiarity&mdash;Zulus
would know him by words pertaining to these.</p>

<p>Natives are not allowed to own or carry firearms or any
weapons used by Europeans. The same restriction applies to
native police. A knobkerry, a pair of handcuffs and a sjambok
(a strip of rhinoceros hide like a short whip) are the only
weapons a native policeman is supplied with. The policy is
a wise one, for, if the blacks knew how to use firearms, it would
mean a constant menace to the whites. Zulus often carry their
assegais with them in their country, and are allowed to carry
sticks at all times, as a dog will attack a black, and the same
dog would not even growl at a white man; besides, deadly
snakes are numerous.</p>

<p>The Zulu system of "telegraphing" news from one part of
the country to another is an interesting accomplishment. Results
of battles and approaching danger are shouted from hilltop
to hilltop for hundreds of miles with surprising speed and
accuracy. In crises Zulus seem to rise out of the ground.</p>

<p>Sugar, salt, kerosene, cotton blankets, tobacco, snuff, lanterns,
Jew's-harps, concertinas, mouth organs, beads, cheap
spangles, bright calicoes, whistles, and numerous other things
of a tawdry character are what Zulus spend their money on.
Six cents is the cheapest purchase he can make, as the three-penny
piece is the smallest coin in circulation. They will
haggle and haggle with a trader sometimes for half an hour
over a six-cent purchase, if the trader will listen to them.</p>

<p>"Bonsella" is a word one will often hear if he has dealings
with the Zulu. "Bonsella" means he wants something that
does not belong to him. With a six-cent purchase he will insist
on a "bonsella." A thin slice of a small bar of soap, a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
grains of sugar, a little pinch of salt, a piece of string will do,
if he cannot do better; and should he fail in getting something
from the trader he will ask for a drink of water.</p>

<p>With similar weapons, and each equally skilled in their use,
and even numbers, one is pretty safe in making the statement
that no man can fight better nor for a longer period than the
Zulu. Their military uniform used to be cow-tails secured
to a ring around the neck. The tails were so thick they presented
the appearance of a complete robe or skin. The Zulu
can store enough food away at one meal to last him for 24
to 36 hours without becoming fatigued. He can run from 50
to 70 miles without stopping. Coupled with these staying
qualities, it was the custom with some of the Zulu kings to kill
all soldiers who returned defeated in battle. That left but
two courses open to him&mdash;death or victory.</p>

<p>The Zulu has but a poor and varied quality of religion.
Some select the sun as their guiding light, others a white bird,
again hawks will appeal to him as being worthy to look up to.
Unlike the Mohammedan, his knees are not calloused from
kneeling to gods of any sort.</p>

<p>Missionaries claim to have 200,000 followers of the Christian
religion, which is nearly one-quarter of the Zulu population&mdash;one
million. People who live in black countries place
little credit to the native for having adopted the European faith.
In fact, there is a prejudice against the mission native. If a
man in South Africa were in need of two "boys," and two mission
"boys" and two kraal "boys" had appeared for work at
the same time, he would at once select the kraal "boys." When
a native begins to wear shoes and a European hat, his usefulness
as an employee generally proves of doubtful quantity.
When he embraces the Christian religion he is limited to but
one wife. That does not absolve him, however, from coming
forward with the cows for his bride.</p>

<p>Zululand, and South Africa generally, is well looked after
by European mounted police. The duty of the mounted police
is to see that firearms do not find their way to the native; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
whisky is not smuggled over the border; to learn if discontent
exists that might turn into a revolution. The native police,
unmounted, arrests natives for minor offenses, and tries to find
out from his brother violations of the law that the white man
could not know other than through his minion.</p>

<p>"Ba, ba" (father), is a native salute to a European. A bow
always accompanies the words. It is customary to return the
native's recognition, although some Europeans will not go to
the trifling trouble to do so, which is discourteous, to say the
least.</p>

<p>Should one be benighted, a European does not think twice
as to whether he will go to a native's hut and sleep on the
floor with the family. In so doing he will be offered every
hospitality.</p>

<p>Deadly, poisonous snakes are so numerous in this section that
settlers carry with them a snakebite outfit. This consists of a
strong cord, a syringe containing a poison antidote, and a small
lance attached. In Zululand and Natal a rattle-snake is considered
almost harmless. The puff adder, that coils itself in
a pathway and is very sluggish, bites one by a backward spring.
His fangs grow that way. He cannot bite after one has passed
him. Death shortly ensues from the bite of this reptile if not
attended to at once.</p>

<p>A person will die in 20 to 30 minutes after being bitten by
a mamba. There are two kinds of this deadly snake&mdash;the
green and black&mdash;but no difference in the quality of poison
they inject into their victim. Death from a mamba's bite is
said to be an awful one. Sometimes the bitten person's head
will burst and appear as a pumpkin would look when thrown
with force on a stone. This will account for the settlers
carrying the snakebite outfit. The cord is used to wrap around
the member bitten above where the fangs entered, to keep the
poison from getting further into the system; the lance is used
to cut out a piece of flesh where bitten, and the syringe is used
to inject the antidote accurately at the raw part of the member
where the fangs stopped. This precautionary measure must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
be gone through within a couple of minutes or one will fall
a victim to the mamba's fangs. The snakes grow in length
from three to four feet.</p>

<p>"Wood and iron" houses&mdash;corrugated iron mostly&mdash;is the
style of European homes seen in Zululand. This also will
apply quite generally to the country districts of South Africa.
A half dozen of these, one story high&mdash;a postoffice, three general
stores, a court house and a hotel&mdash;are the buildings about
which the commercial life of Melmoth centers. A church
building is generally numbered among these groups, and always
a graveyard out of proportion. Many of the hotels of Zululand
are built somewhat on the kraal plan. The dining and
sitting rooms&mdash;sometimes one room answers both purposes&mdash;are
in a one-story "wood and iron" building. Many of the
bedrooms&mdash;small houses resting on posts a foot to eighteen
inches from the ground&mdash;are located a short distance from the
main building, which they sometimes half-encircle. Each house,
by partitioning, contains several small bedrooms. The beds
with which these rooms are furnished are generally half-size
iron ones, and the light provided is often a candle.</p>

<p>"Keep to the native trail until you come to that clump of
wattle trees," directed the driver of the post cart when ten
miles from Melmoth on my return to Ginginhlovu. A printer
who had got tired of the smell of printers' ink moved to
Zululand to make his living in the dual capacity of farmer and
trader. So, with a grip in my hand, I started over the Zulu
trail to the clump of trees in the distance. I had not gone far
when I heard a shout, but could not tell whence it came. It
may be the natives telegraphing the start of an uprising, I
mused. "Halloa!" was again heard, and, looking in another
direction, a wide-brimmed hat was looming over the arch of a
grassy hill. It was the printer. The post cart driver had
"set me down," as a Britisher would say, at the wrong trail.</p>

<p>"The natives wouldn't sell me any chickens when I first came
here, so I wouldn't sell them any goods unless they paid for
them with chickens," was one of the difficulties the printer-trader
recounted in his effort to hew his way in Zululand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"Sarah," addressing his wife, "come with us this afternoon
while we visit the natives' huts, as you can speak the language
better than I," obligingly suggested the sturdy trader, who had
beaten freight trains over the United States, sailed before the
mast, and had tramped the desert of West Australia to the gold
mines at Coolgardie.</p>

<p>Through the trader's wife we chatted with the Zulu women
hoeing corn, with their pickaninnies on their backs. Later we
squeezed through the small entrances into hut after hut. The
lady of the Zulu home explained how the natives winnowed
the mealy meal by blowing the dust or bran from it with their
breath when passing from the hands, to lodge in a wooden
bowl under; how they stirred the meal; explained their scanty
washing outfit, how the wives got along together, and other
interesting features of Zulu life. After spending several interesting
days at the printer-trader's home, it was time to say
good-by; and I left with a keen feeling of indebtedness for
the unstinted hospitality and kindness shown me.</p>

<p>"I've kept my word&mdash;I've got the eggs!" remarked
Graham when we had pulled up at his place for luncheon on
the return trip.</p>

<p>With pages left unwritten of the Zulu, the strongest, most
intelligent and best built tribe of the Bantu race, we will leave
the sailor's place for Eshowe, take the post cart to Ginginhlovu,
and return by rail to Durban.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>My first introduction to South Africa railway travel took
place on my initial trip to Johannesburg. The compartment
type of corridor carriage, as passenger coaches are termed, with
an aisle at the side, similar to that of Great Britain, is in use.
Meter gauge&mdash;3 feet 6 inches&mdash;is the standard of that country,
14 inches narrower than what is known as "standard
gauge"&mdash;4 feet 8 inches&mdash;in the United States and in some
of the European countries. The narrow spaces of the compartment
(6 by 6½ feet) inclined one to wish for a two person
seat. Two out of a filled compartment have direct access to a
window&mdash;the two passengers whose seats are the outside end
ones. Most travelers have seats reserved, in some instances a
week in advance, their names being written on a card on the
outside of the car at the compartment assigned.</p>

<p>Compartments in the railway coaches are heated with what
is called foot-warmers&mdash;that is, sometimes the compartment
will be provided with this device. The foot-warmer is an iron
pipe, two feet long, eight inches wide, three inches thick, and
filled with hot water. The foot-warmer is all right when
there are but two persons in a compartment, or when two foot-warmers
are supplied and four persons occupy a compartment,
but when six or eight passengers occupy a compartment&mdash;well,
16 passengers' feet cannot get on four feet of piping. That is
the only means of heating passenger coaches in South Africa.</p>

<p>In some respects accommodation is better on South African
trains than in the United States and Europe&mdash;every passenger
having a place to sleep, for instance. Six persons can sleep in
a compartment, but five is generally the maximum number assigned,
the extra berth being reserved for hand baggage. Frequently,
when travel is light, one has a compartment to himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
The back of the compartment against which one leans
while riding is portable, and when pulled out straight is fastened
at each end. Above that shelf, or berth, is another. The
same applies to the opposite side of the compartment, which,
with seats on each side, termed the lower berths, make six in
all&mdash;three on each side. These berths, or sleeping shelves,
are two feet wide and upholstered. Travelers generally carry
with them a cushion and blanket, or rug, as it is termed, which
is used for sleeping purposes. The bedding furnished by the
railway cost 60 cents. If one is traveling two nights in succession
the bedding is rolled up by a steward in the morning
and put on the top shelf of the compartment, where it remains
during the day, and is taken down the second night for use.
Sixty cents for two nights&mdash;30 cents a night. Meals on the
train are very reasonable. Breakfast and luncheon costs 50
cents and dinner 60 cents. So, paying but 60 cents for a bed,
as it were, and not more than 60 cents for a meal, one finds a
great reduction in traveling expenses in South Africa compared
to what is charged for the same service in the United States.
Railroad fare is higher, however, than in America, the second
class rate being three and four cents a mile, and first-class
six cents a mile. A hundred pounds of baggage is
allowed a passenger. The schedule is slow compared with
that in England and on some roads in America, twenty-five
miles an hour being as fast as trains run. Long delays take
place at stations, for when a passenger train stops it often seems
as if it had been abandoned.</p>

<p>From Durban to Pietermaritzburg, a distance of 70 miles,
an elevation of 3,000 feet is ascended. Some cultivated land
is seen from the train, but grassy, timberless hills, with smoke
and flames from prairie fires showing here and there off the
railway, is what a stranger notices continuously.</p>

<p>Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal, was first settled by
the Dutch. The town hall, postoffice, and government buildings
are imposing structures. In addition, one finds a small
museum, botanical garden and good city parks, an electric
railway system and a good railway station. One is surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
when visiting small cities located so far out of the world, as it
seems, to find them so up to date. Locally, the place is called,
for short, Maritzburg.</p>

<p>The Voortrekkers' Church is a historical monument to, and
a solemn reminder of, the terrible sufferings of the Voortrekkers
during the dark days between the massacres by the hordes
of Dingaan, the Zulu king, of over 600 men, women and children,
in February, 1838, and the eventful overthrowing of Zulu
power, at Blood River, in December of the same year. The
massacre of Piet Retief, leader of a colony of Boer emigrants,
and some of his band by the native despot at the head kraal,
and the slaughter of his followers at Weenen, which immediately
followed, is closely identified with the erection of the
church. Retief and some of his followers had been led to believe
that Dingaan wished to make friends of them. While in
the king's kraal, they were seized and massacred. Andries Pretorius,
with 450 men, some months later, started on an expedition
to avenge the massacre. Religious services were held
every day during the march of the expedition, and a vow was
made by Pretorius' party that, if they came out victorious in
battle with the bloodthirsty and perfidious Zulu king, a church
to the honor of God would be erected. Pretorius and his
burghers met the Zulu forces at a river then unnamed. Fifteen
thousand natives were arrayed against 450 Boers. After several
hours' fighting the Zulus fled, leaving behind 5,000 dead
and wounded. The river was said to be red with the blood
that flowed from wounded natives, and that stream has since
been known as Blood River. Dingaan's Day, December 16,
one of the national holidays in South Africa, is observed in
honor of the bravery of Pretorius and his followers and the
avenging of the foul massacre of Piet Retief and his band of
emigrants. The church promised by Pretorius was built in
1841, three years later.</p>

<p>Maritzburg natives are mostly Basutos, the only tribe in
South Africa that white troops have never conquered. Most
of Basutoland is situated in the Drakensburg Mountains, some
parts of which contain rich land. They have a king, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
said to be wealthy. Europeans cannot travel in Basutoland
without permission from the ruler or some high native officer.
A large amount of firearms and munitions of war is said to
have been smuggled into their country. The Basuto is feared
by all in South Africa, and that will explain why Basutoland
is for Basutos only.</p>

<p>Now we travel northward to Ladysmith, passing Spion Kop
south of the Siege City. Ragged turrets and spires are still to
be seen, bearing gaping evidence of the days of suffering, hunger
and fear that the brave besieged underwent in the Boer war.
Historical Majuba Hill next comes in view, with Mount Prospect
opposite. A tunnel has been bored through the land lying
between Majuba and Mount Prospect, known as Laing's Nek.
We travel over rough territory for a while, then find ourselves
on the high veld, having left the Drakensburg mountain range
behind. Continuing to Charlestown, on the south bank of the
Vaal River, and crossing the river to Voxburg, we passed out
of Natal and were in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>"When do we scoff?" asked a passenger, at one stage of the
journey. The term being a strange one, "I don't know" was
what a stranger would reply. "Luncheon is ready" announced
a train steward just then as he passed the compartment.
"Let's go and scoff. I'm hungry," said the South African.
"Scoff," in South Africa, has the same meaning here
as "grub" in the United States.</p>

<p>The River Vaal is the boundary line between the Transvaal
Province, Natal Province and the Orange Free State. The
meaning of "Transvaal" is, across the Vaal&mdash;trans-Vaal.</p>

<p>On we go over the grassy veld, or prairie, seeing very little
cultivated ground, but cattle are grazing here and there. They
are a brand peculiar to South Africa; their horns grow from
two to three feet, their legs in keeping with the long horns, but
their bodies are narrow and of light weight. The most productive
feature of the veld were ant-hills, ranging in size from
a water bucket to a hogshead. Thousands of these, as far as
the eye could reach, mar the green landscape as freckles or
small-pox mark an unblemished skin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>The railroad from Durban to Johannesburg is the crookedest
one might ride over. To save building a small bridge,
the track turns for miles before it gets back to a straight line.
When the railway was built the contractors were paid by the
mile. Were the road constructed on ordinary scientific lines,
the distance between the two cities could be reduced fifty miles.
Yet, neat, well-built, attractive stations, surrounded with
flower beds, were passed all the way.</p>

<p>Over the freckled veld we rolled, with Johannesburg in the
distance. The sky was clear, as most always, on the highlands
of the Transvaal. We had traveled to over 6,000 feet above
sea level. Objects in the distance became less distinct&mdash;a
haze seemed to gather. It was the smoke from the gold mines
on the great Gold Reef&mdash;</p>

<p>"Johannesburg!"&mdash;"Johannesburg!" a train guard announced.</p>

<p>A well built business city is the impression made by this
great gold center of the world. A long street, with all the
business of the city centered in it, one would expect to find on
reaching Johannesburg. That is the style of some of our
western mining towns. Instead, here are buildings, five to
eight stories in height, of stone, brick, and steel, some of them
a city block square in dimension, with arcades leading from one
street to another; large plate glass windows where goods are
attractively displayed; elevators and steam heat appliances&mdash;all
centralized in a space five squares in extent. This is the
retail section of Johannesburg. The great banking and mining
companies' buildings&mdash;splendid structures, all of modern
architecture&mdash;are situated half a dozen squares from this
center. The financial district is a busy place.</p>

<p>"Come, buyers! Come, buyers! Come, buyers!" the
auctioneer cries when he has an assignment to sell something in
the marketplace. Every one is used to the call, and soon a
group gathers around. "How much&mdash;how much&mdash;how
much?" the auctioneer starts with his glib sale talk. The articles
to be sold may be crates of oranges, bunches of bananas, a
crate of chickens, geese, hares, wild fowl, pumpkins, tomatoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
turnips, cornmeal, oats, hay, a pig, cattle, buck (deer), wildebeeste
(gnu)&mdash;anything edible for man and beast. Dozens
of auctioneers are selling goods in the Johannesburg market at
the same time.</p>

<p>"That fellow is one of the lost tribe of Israel we read about
in the Bible," spoke a Britisher who had been a produce dealer
on the Johannesburg market for twenty years. "When the
Rand was opened to the world," he continued, "the lost tribe
cropped up in the Transvaal and that fellow is one of them."
The buyer was engaged in a controversy with the old dealer,
the point at issue hinging on one chicken, the Israelite contending
he had bought thirteen hens, and the dealer maintaining
there were only twelve to be sold. Arguments are taking
place all the time between buyer, seller and auctioneer.</p>

<p>Fifteen wildebeeste (gnu), with bent horns, and whiskers six
inches long growing straight from their noses; blesbuck, bushbuck,
springbuck by the dozens, lay on the ground in the market.
Meat from these animals is sold as venison. Seeing these
beasts of the plains stretched out in plain view, about which
most people read but do not see, creates a far-off feeling&mdash;a
feeling that, were the eyes shut to the brick and mortar walls
close by, one would be in a wild, unblazed section of the world.</p>

<p>Hundreds of ox teams in the market ground worm their way
through piles of bags, hay and transports, led by the natives
with bare feet and bare head. A South African ox team numbers
nine yoke&mdash;18 oxen. The transport, or wagon, is 18
feet long and strongly built. Seven feet of the rear is generally
covered with canvas, and under the "tent" is the home
of the Boer, and often his wife, as weeks must elapse from the
time a start has been made for market until their return, as the
farms, in a great many instances, are located long distances
from large towns. Time saving is not a factor in a great many
sections of the sub-continent. The oxen plod slowly along
an unkept road, always preceded by a kafir, who guides the
caravan by rhinoceros-hide strips attached to the horns of the
leading team. After traveling about three hours, a stop
("outspan") is made for the cattle to feed, as grass grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
bountifully on the veld. So, allowing time for "outspanning"
and "inspanning," 10 to 15 miles a day is generally the distance
covered by a transport. "Salted" cattle are the only
ones in demand for working purposes. "Salted," when used
in speaking of oxen, signifies that cattle can run the gauntlet
of many diseases that so often bare the veld of grazing stock.
These are cattle that have been sick but survived the attack.
"Unsalted" stock are in little demand, as they often get sick
after starting from the farmer's home and die by the roadside.</p>

<p>One automobile to 15 persons is a high percentage in a city
with about 100,000 white population, yet that indicates the
wealth of the gold city on the high veld. There are over 800
automobiles and the same number of motorcycles in Johannesburg,
and among these are the largest, most expensive and
swiftest manufactured.</p>

<p>The term "The Rand" embraces the mining districts of the
Reef, and "Witwatersrand" is used when speaking of the districts
located close to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Sixty miles of smokestacks&mdash;from Krugersdorp to Springs&mdash;will
suggest at once the magnitude of the great Gold Reef.
Dynamite is blasting the gold-bearing ore for that distance 24
hours a day; black smoke is rolling out of high smokestacks
from strong fires, under boilers in which steam is generated to
furnish power to hoist the ore from thousands of feet underground
to the stamp mills at the top; great dirt heaps&mdash;cyanide
banks, as they are termed&mdash;circle about and wall in
thrifty mining towns, that are not seen until a train stops at a
railway station; monster stamp mills, whose crushing machinery
resembles the roar of a sea beating on a rocky shore, are grinding
the quartz into powdered dust&mdash;for nearly thirty years the
Reef has been exploited, and is still giving up its precious ore.
Hundreds of thousands of people are engaged in this gold mining
industry; the eyes of the money people of the world are
constantly watching the gold yield of the Rand.</p>

<p>In 1884 the output of the Transvaal gold mines was
$55,000, and, save for a few years, during which the Boer war
was being fought, the output increased until it has reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
enormous sum of $150,000,000 a year. The monthly output
is from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000.</p>

<p>The stamps that crush the ore into powdered dust weigh from
1,800 to 2,000 pounds. Under the stamps are zinc-lined inclining
tables, 10 feet long and 4 feet wide, covered with quicksilver.
Water washes the thin dust over the tables, when the
gold adheres to the quicksilver. The dust from five stamps
passes over one table. When about an eighth of an inch of
gold sediment has accumulated, the stamps cease working, and
the residue is scraped off the zinc. The scrapings look like thick
black mud. The sediment then goes through a drying process.
The dried chunks of gold "mud" are next put in a kettle, or
retort, and melted. Borax is tossed into the hot metal, which
separates impurities from the gold, the precious metal remaining
at the bottom of the kettle, the dross keeping to the top. More
gold "mud" is put in the kettle, until there is enough to make
a brick, or ingot. The gold metal is poured into a mold. Cooling
in a few minutes, the red hot brick is dumped on the floor.
The shape of an ingot is similar to a sponge cake, narrower at
the bottom than at the top. The weight of an ingot is 1,000
ounces, its value about $20,000.</p>

<p>In early years the dirt that passed over the quicksilver was
considered of little value, and was washed away. The dirt is
now treated by what is termed the cyanide process. Remaining
in large cyanide tanks, any gold contained in the dirt is reduced
to a liquid. The liquid next goes to the extracting
room, where it passes through inclining tanks, 12 feet long by
6 feet wide, composed of five compartments. The floors of
these tanks are covered with 8 inches of zinc shavings. The
liquid slowly passes from one compartment to another. Any
gold contained in the chemical solution adheres to the zinc
shavings. The shavings are then taken from the tank and put
in a retort. At the same time sulphuric acid is placed in the
retort, which causes the zinc to dissolve. The sediment in this
instance is also like black mud. This is next put through a
drying process, put in another retort, when the gold can be
seen, poured into a mold, and dumped on a floor in ingot form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Some of the mine owners are very obliging to visitors who wish
to look about the works. The mines range in depth from
2,000 to 4,000 feet.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand Europeans and 200,000 natives are employed
in the Rand mines. Paul Kruger, nearly 30 years ago,
fixed the wages of the white miner at $5 a day. Contract
miners, however, earn as much as from $200 to $300 a month;
but the average wage of the Rand miner is $160 a month. The
natives' wage runs from 50 cents to a dollar a day and board.
The hours worked are eight, three shifts comprising a day's
force.</p>

<p>Compound is the term used for an enclosure in which native
employes are kept. As many as 3,000 to 4,000 kafirs work in
some of the mines. From the mine they go to the compound,
where a bunk is provided, a place to make a fire, and food is
furnished. They are not allowed outside the enclosure at night,
but on Sundays and holidays most of them are free. Tact has
to be exercised when assigning kafirs to their quarters and to
working mates, as a hostile feeling exists between certain tribes.
If members of unfriendly clans be not kept apart, fights and
murders often occur.</p>

<p>Weasel-eyed, idle, easy living Europeans are found in considerable
numbers in mining districts. Were the natives allowed
their liberty in the evening, it would result in their complete
demoralization, for the crafty gentry would succeed in
getting bad whisky or vicious rum into the compounds, receiving
a big price for the poison, in addition to offering inducements
to the "boys" to pilfer nuggets or heavy-bearing gold
quartz.</p>

<p>"Scarcity of help, scarcity of help," is the cry of mine owners
in South Africa. Sharp competition prevails between mining
companies for "boys," and it is a scarcity of this class of labor
to which they allude. A European trader may have the confidence
of natives in the district in which his store is located,
and when help is wanted labor agents call on the merchant.
When a trader induces natives to go to the mines, the firm to
which they have been sent will pay him $15 for each "boy"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
as a bonus. If the company failed to pay the bonus, it would
thereafter get very few "boys" from that trader's district.
In thickly populated centers like Kaffraria a dealer may control
as many as 1,000 natives. In such instances companies pay
him an income of from $100 to $125 a month, in addition to
the $15 a head, in order to keep in his good graces. If a "boy"
should engage to work for the shorter term&mdash;six months&mdash;and
rehire at the end of the term, the trader from whose district
the kafir originally came would be sent an additional sum
of $15. Where labor agents deal with native chiefs for mine
"boys," the chief expects a "bonsella" of $2.50 for every
"boy" leaving his district to work in the mines. With
bonuses, clothes, car fare and other incidentals, it costs the mine
company from $25 to $30 to get a "boy" from the kraal to
the works. Mine owners claim they pay out a quarter of a
million dollars a year in bonuses for native help. It is also
claimed that the mining industry could not be conducted at a
profit with all white labor.</p>

<p>Twenty-one thousand graves in Braamfontein Cemetery, a
great many of these containing two corpses, strongly emphasizes
the terrible toll of human life paid to King Gold in the
Transvaal mines. This is but one European graveyard, as
there are several smaller burying places in the Johannesburg
district. Besides those in which only Dutch and English are
buried, there are Jewish, Malay and Mohammedan graveyards
scattered about the city. Braamfontein Cemetery is filled,
and a new one is filling fast. This appalling mortality has
taken place during the past 30 years.</p>

<p>Eighty-nine open graves&mdash;mound after mound in as regular
order as are boards in a floor&mdash;is a gruesome setting that
forces one to cast a sad glance at the clouds of black smoke pouring
out of the hundreds of smokestacks on the great Gold Reef,
and at the gray-colored cyanide banks that half encircle the
city of Johannesburg. These unbroken rows of freshly dug
graves were in the European section of Brixton graveyard, and
at the other end of the large burying ground&mdash;the native section&mdash;eighty
freshly dug graves presented a grim foreground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"Bubonic plague?" the reader may ask. No, phthisis.</p>

<p>Eighty in a thousand of ordinary miners, and 140 in a thousand
of workers using underground drilling machines, are affected
with phthisis. As gold-bearing rock is being blasted all
the time, miners inhale the fine dust during working hours.
Respirators, a device covering the nose and mouth, having a
sponge at the mouth, and two openings at the side covered with
a fine wire screen to admit of air, are worn by some of the
workers, but, as it proves cumbersome, a great many miners
discard that life-extending invention. Phthisis here signifies
the drying up of the lungs. The dust inhaled settles in the cells
of the lungs, with the appalling result mentioned.</p>

<p>Seven years is the average lifetime of the Rand miner. On
the headstones in Braamfontein Cemetery, carved in granite,
most of the ages are found to be in the twenties and thirties.
Few stones observed bore ages of 40 years and over.</p>

<p>The average number of burials in Johannesburg is ten a day;
Europeans average four and natives six. People not engaged
in underground work, and not connected with the mines in any
capacity, also become affected with phthisis. As on American
prairies, the wind blows on the veld nearly all the time, and
generally with considerable force; hence the air is full of dust
from the powder-crushed cyanide banks.</p>

<p>Priest, preacher and missionary may be seen at cemetery
gates all the time, more particularly in the afternoons.</p>

<p>"Will there be any more funerals today?" was asked of a
native who had just filled in a grave.</p>

<p>"Yes, baas. Two wagons coming now," he answered,
pointing to the road.</p>

<p>The natives are buried in a burlap sack, drawn tight and
sewed, reducing the natural size of the body considerably.
Two corpses rest on the bottom of a grave. Six inches of
dirt cover these, when two more of the sacked bodies are
lowered, making four in one grave.</p>

<p>The city of Johannesburg receive $7 for every kafir buried
in Brixton graveyard&mdash;$28 for a grave containing the bodies
of four natives. The owners of the mines at which the natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
had worked must pay this burial charge. Deaths of natives
are caused more by accidents in mines than from phthisis,
as kafirs will not, as a rule, work more than six months in the
year.</p>

<p>At the end of Brixton graveyard, where Europeans are buried,
could be seen, from a distance, undertakers in long coats and
high hats; hearses, ornamented with white or black cockades,
drawn by horses of the same color; clergymen, their heads
bowed and reading from books, with groups of veiled people
huddled in small areas&mdash;putting people underground and the
circumstances attending these ceremonies are of very frequent
occurrence in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The grave-diggers have no slack seasons; they are busy the
year round, which accounted for so many open graves. As
they were sure to be needed, it was better to be ahead of the
demand than crowded with orders.</p>

<p>"Don't Expectorate!" is the cautionary sign confronting one
at almost every turn in the Gold City. Where the "Don't
Spit!" sign appears frequently one knows he has reached a
place where lung trouble is prevalent.</p>

<p>Paved streets in some of the South African cities has not
been considered so much of a municipal duty as in other parts
of the world. The soil being hard, the rain, coming in showers,
flows off as it does on paved streets. As the sun shines
365 days in the year on the high veld, the ground is dry in a
short time after a shower has passed.</p>

<p>Walking in the streets instead of on the walks is a local
custom one quickly notices. In Johannesburg good, wide walks
may be practically free of people though the street space is occupied
by pedestrians from curb to curb.</p>

<p>"Joburg" is the local term used almost exclusively by South
Africans when speaking of Johannesburg. When one hears
another say "Johannesburg" it is a pretty sure sign that he is
a stranger in "Darkest Africa."</p>

<p>Living expenses are much higher in Johannesburg and other
up-country cities than on the coast. House rent runs from
$25 to $40 a month; meat was 18 cents to 30 cents a pound;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
street car fare is very high; in a general sense, expenses are 20
per cent. higher than in the coast cities. Boarding houses
charge from $35 to $40 a month; hotel accommodation is expensive,
too, the cheapest costing $3 a day; rooms cost $1.25
a day in all the hotels. Six cents is the least sum for any small
article. A newspaper costs six cents (threepence), the bootblacks
charge 12 cents for a shine, barbers 18 cents for shaving;
it seemed as if one was handing out six cents at every few
squares to a street-car conductor, so short are the "stages"&mdash;in
fact, few things can be had for less than six cents.</p>

<p>Dutch, British and Jews comprise the majority of the population,
Jews numbering one-third. Germans are also quite numerous.
Americans, up to the time of the Boer War, held high
positions with mining companies, but they have been thinned
out since the country changed hands. Every country of the
globe is represented in that cosmopolitan center.</p>

<p>On pay days "Joburg" is a lively place. The saloons seem
to get the biggest part of miners' wages. They spend their
money like lords. In no place are bars better patronized.
A glass of beer costs 12 cents, and stronger drinks 24 cents.
The barmaid, a woman engaged tending bars in public drinking
places in British territories, is not seen behind the bar of
saloons in cities and towns of the Transvaal, men being engaged
at that work.</p>

<p>Years ago, when the game of baseball was played, which took
place weekly and on holidays, crowds of people used to attend.
Games are still played at weekly intervals, but only a few attend&mdash;sometimes
not more than 100 persons. On the other
hand, big crowds attend the English games&mdash;cricket and football.</p>

<p>"Closed on account of dust." "Open&mdash;Closed on account
of dust." Such signs will be found secured to doors of most
business houses. The wind blows so generally, and nearly
always so strongly, that all doors must be kept closed, whether
of business or dwelling. With unpaved streets, and the half-circle
of great cyanide banks about the city, Johannesburg, as
appearing to some visitors, is not a choice place of residence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
The climate of the Rand possesses one virtue&mdash;there is no
malarial fever. On the other hand, the lips swell, chafe and
crack from the effects of both the wind and high altitude, this
causing an irritating feeling. Laundries do a good business
here. Collars are changed twice a day, as the soil, being red,
and the almost constant high winds, with the dry nature of the
country, keeps the dust flying about most of the time. One
will not have lived in this city long before he will have eaten
his allotted "peck of dirt."</p>

<p>In Ludlow Street Jail, New York, prisoners are kept who
are not considered criminals&mdash;that class of men who cannot
pay their debts and who have not been adjudged insolvent. The
city pays for their food. In Johannesburg, if a man is sent to
jail for a debt, the creditor must pay the city 50 cents a day
for the debtor's board. Precious few prisoners of this class
are found in the Johannesburg jail.</p>

<p>Newspapers of the Rand are fully up to the requirements of
the city, four dailies being published, two morning and two
evening. The morning papers issue Sunday editions, one of
these including a colored magazine section. It has required
constant fighting by the owners to maintain the Sunday editions,
as it is an innovation in British territory. Opponents
had injunctions issued against these publications, and in other
ways the publishers were put to much inconvenience. This edition
still appears on the street, however, but, by a court decree,
dealers and newsboys are prohibited from soliciting sales.
Printers earn good wages on the Rand, running from $30 to
$55 weekly, with the working hours seven and eight. One
finds here linotype machines, web presses, color presses, stereotyping&mdash;all
the modern machinery in use in the North. South
Africa is the one country where printers can do as well, and
sometimes better, than in the United States.</p>

<p>Mechanics and miners are so well organized that they have
a building of their own. They pull together on election day,
and, as a result, a number of union labor men are sprinkled
about the upper and lower Houses of Parliament. Eight hours
is the maximum working day in South Africa among skilled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
mechanics and miners. Wages run from $4.50 to $6 a day.</p>

<p>In years gone by the Dutch suffered so much from the natives
during their treks that they have a pretty good idea of how to
manage them. No blacks crowd Europeans off the walks in
Johannesburg, for the black man is not allowed on them; he
must walk in the street. This policy saves trouble for both
black and white, for it prevents arguments and fights. He is
not allowed to ride on street cars. In railroad compartments
colored and half-castes are prohibited from intermingling with
Europeans. "Reserved" is posted on the doors of certain compartments,
in which one generally would find well-to-do colored
passengers.</p>

<p>The native is not allowed to live in towns and cities here.
What are termed "locations" are built by the municipality,
and in these places the natives are kept to themselves. The
Boer plan is much better than the English, as, if the black man
be given too much liberty, it generally proves injurious to him.
Dutch authorities are very severe on men smuggling liquor to
natives. Five hundred dollars is the fine, and in default of
payment the smuggler must serve five years in jail.</p>

<p>Indians leaving Natal for the Transvaal generally come to
grief. On arrival they are promptly taken into custody, and
when 50 to 100 have been collected are put into box cars of a
train headed for Portuguese territory, and soon find themselves
in the hold of a ship sailing from Lourenzo Marques for India.
Indians have spoiled the Province of Natal, so the Dutch are
taking care that that race do not get the money that belongs
to the white man in the Transvaal. Though Indians are British
subjects, it makes no difference to the Dutch. Australia
has barred them from that country, too.</p>

<p>An art gallery, a museum, a large public library, a good zoo,
sports grounds, parks where music is furnished, theaters,
schools, churches, hospitals&mdash;all the public accessories that
make a city are found in Johannesburg; also most modern city
fire-fighting appliances, an electric street car system, electric
and gas plants, fully in keeping with those in cities of the same
size located in the countries of the North.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Necessity is the mother of invention," so, as there is practically
no timber in South Africa, and brick buildings cost quite
a sum of money to erect, homes had to be made of something
else. Corrugated iron was the material that answered the purpose
of brick, wood and stone. About all the timber required
to erect one of these houses is for joists, scantlings, and
doors. The sheets of corrugated iron are nailed to the joists
and to the scantling at the roof. Sometimes there are plastered
interiors, but a great many have no more protection than the
sheet of iron. They are very hot in summer and very cold in
winter. They pop and crack all the time from expansion and
contraction. These houses are seldom more than one story
high. "Wood and iron" buildings is what they are called.</p>

<p>"Pipe Hospital" may be seen over the door of a tobacco
store. It means that pipes are repaired there.</p>

<p>A broad-brimmed hat, with a thick outside band, the latter
often brown, with a white speck here and there, is the head-covering
worn in the interior of South Africa. It is the only
hat a Dutchman wears. Derby hats are in little demand in
that part of the world. One occasionally sees a man wearing
that style, but soft hats hold the day.</p>

<p>Snow fell in Johannesburg a few years since, the first in 20
years, and it proved an epoch in the history of the country.
Important events that took place before or since are referred
to as having occurred before or after the storm. Still, the
weather gets cold enough to freeze water, but the sun warms
up everything in the daytime. By reason of the high altitude&mdash;over
6,000 feet&mdash;the weather is never too hot in summer.</p>

<p>To General Louis Botha the people of not only South Africa,
but of the world, owe a great debt for saving the Rand mines.
The time Botha rendered this service was when Lord Roberts,
with his invincible forces, was outside the gates of Johannesburg
prepared to enter the city. Most of the gold mines on the
Rand had been wired and powerful explosives placed at sections
where the greatest damage would take place from an
explosion. It was planned that as soon as Lord Roberts entered
the city an electric button would be pressed to set off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the bombs, which would ruin the mines. Botha, of course, was
well aware of what was to occur. A messenger was dispatched
by him to Lord Roberts, bearing a request from the Boer commander
to delay entering the city for 24 hours. Lord Roberts
acceded to the request. During the interval General Botha
pleaded with his Boer sympathizers not to blow up the mines.
It required his utmost persuasive ability to dissuade the men
from carrying out their purpose. He eventually got their promise
that the mines would not be molested. Had Botha been
narrow-minded or vindictive, instead of a broad-minded man,
in dealing with Lord Roberts, the world's output of gold since
that time would probably have been from $100,000,000 to
$120,000,000 less annually.</p>

<p>Johannesburg is named after a Boer&mdash;Johannes&mdash;whose
farm was located on a portion of the Gold Reef. It was about
1885 when gold was discovered.</p>

<p>The Great Trek by the Dutch from Cape Colony to the
Transvaal took place in 1835-38. Being dissatisfied with
English administration in Cape Colony, they, like the Mormons
in America, kept going into uninhabited parts, stopping only
when they believed they had gone beyond reach of everybody,
where they could live their own lives in their own way. There
were thousands in the Great Trek. In 1852 a government
was formed, and M. W. Pretorious became the first President
of the South African Republic. In the early seventies there
were about 25,000 Boers in the Transvaal. In 1876 the republic
practically collapsed, when England assumed responsibility.
In 1877 the British flag was raised in Pretoria, but the
Dutch did not relish that innovation. During 1881 the Boers
attacked the English garrisons, and in January, 1882, the British
suffered successive defeats at Majuba Hill, under command
of General Colley, the latter being killed at Ingogo Heights.
Eight hundred English officers and men were killed in the engagements,
and on the Boer side 18 were killed and 33 wounded.
A few lean years for the Dutch followed. Later, the gold
fields of Barberton sprang into existence, then the Rand, and
undreamed of wealth poured into the Transvaal, towns springing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
up as if by magic. It was during this early heyday period
of the Rand that adventurous spirits such as Barnato, Hammond,
Beit, Rhodes and others figured prominently in the life
of Boerland&mdash;some there by reason of the opportunity to vent
their inborn desire for adventure, others as agents of Great
Britain, but all playing for high stakes round the green table
of the great Gold Reef. With the exception of the Jameson
Raid, in 1895, the Boers enjoyed peace and prosperity up to
the opening of the Anglo-Boer war in 1899, when, three years
later, the Transvaal and Orange Free State became British
possessions.</p>

<p>On May 31, 1910, the four provinces&mdash;Cape of Good Hope,
Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal&mdash;became the Union
of South Africa, with General Louis Botha, Premier, his Cabinet,
save one, being composed of Dutch members. Each province
has its legislature, like our State legislature. A governor-general,
appointed by the King of England, is the representative
of the Imperial Government in South Africa and Rhodesia.
With the exception of eight Senators, appointed by the Governor-General,
the members of the National and Provincial
Parliaments are elected by popular vote. One is safe, commercially
speaking, in saying Johannesburg is more than half of
Boerland.</p>

<p>Law and order in the Gold City conform to the British
standard. Noted crooks and adventurers are found about
places where gold and diamonds are mined, yet few big burglaries
take place. In stature, the policemen of Johannesburg
are second to none. They are of splendid physique. Native
policemen are used in that city also.</p>

<p>The ravages of cattle diseases in South Africa is strongly
suggested on seeing refrigerator cars being emptied of frozen
meat. The poorer portions of beeves and sheep find their way
to the compounds, the meat being eaten by the mine "boys."
The frozen meat comes from Australia and New Zealand, arriving
every week, and is shipped to what is called an agricultural
country.</p>

<p>What seems an inexcusable lack of enterprise, combined with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
mismanagement, is seen at every turn. Cattle hides are shipped
to Europe, while boots and shoes worn in South Africa are
made in England, Germany, Holland or the United States.
Wool is shipped to centers North, and hence all the woolen
goods come from Europe. One may ride through sections
that should make splendid farming districts, but these are held
by landowners in tracts of from 2,000 to 30,000 acres, and
only a small area is under cultivation. Lack of water is the
reason given. One sees no windmills, however. Rain water
is often stored in a crude pond, which is generally muddy from
sheep and cattle walking in it. This dirty drinking water
alone is enough to kill the stock.</p>

<p>Every animal of field and farm seems to have a mortal enemy.
With the cattle, one of three diseases&mdash;East Coast or tick
fever, rinderpest and red water&mdash;is apt to decimate them at
any time; two or three diseases wipe out sheep; there is what
is termed "horse sickness," horses also dying from eating grass
when dew is on the ground, and meningitis menaces mules.</p>

<p>At least four drawbacks figure in raising grain&mdash;drought,
hailstones, locusts and poor farming&mdash;the worst being the
presence of the black man, meaning poor farming; though his
hut rent keeps the white man's coffee-pot boiling, at the same
time it unhands him industrially. When one sees a piece of
plowed land it is generally but half plowed, a grassy strip
of sod often appearing between furrows at some part of the
field. It would be a rare thing to see unplowed strips between
furrows in England, on the Continent, or in most of the
farming States of America.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>The Dutch being averse to having the capital near the sea
coast, as soon as they gained full control of United South
Africa, on May 31, 1910, they decided on Pretoria as the capital,
although Capetown was well provided with good legislative
buildings. Money was then appropriated to erect government
buildings in Pretoria, and a hill east of the city was selected
as a site for the Parliament buildings. Following this, a large
force of government employes were compelled to leave Capetown
for Pretoria, as government business was in future to be
transacted in the Transvaal instead of the Cape of Good Hope.
At present Pretoria, 45 miles from Johannesburg, is the capital
of United South Africa. Before the war the Boers exercised
control over only the Transvaal and Orange Free State, but 11
years later they also exercised authority over the Provinces of
the Cape of Good Hope and Natal.</p>

<p>One who had imagined he would not find modern utilities
and attractiveness of a general nature in a place located 'way
up on the veld would be much taken aback upon entering Pretoria.
Encircled by a range of hills is this, the best-looking
large town in the interior of South Africa. The city being so
far away from the busy centers of the world, and over a thousand
miles inland from Capetown, one would not expect to
find fine, clean streets, a good electric street railway system,
good parks, in some of which music is furnished; shade trees,
water fountains, and splendid buildings&mdash;residential, business,
municipal and governmental.</p>

<p>The Dutch Reformed Church, built in the center of the old
market square, around which long ox teams used to slowly
worm their way and seek shelter behind its stone walls from
winds and shade from the sun; where auctioneers, chattering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
like monkeys, sold produce of burghers, brought from points a
hundred miles in some instances, to the highest bidder; where
Boer met Boer and sympathized with each other during lean
years, discussed native wars, their troubles with England, and
the ravages of locusts and rinderpest; where the last President
of the Transvaal intermingled with his people, walking among
the piles of pumpkins, calabashes, tomatoes, guinea fowl, chickens,
hares, and buck; where, on holy days, Psalms were sung
by these rough-looking plainsmen&mdash;this historical assembling
place of burghers, with its old-time and latter-day memories,
has been removed, and the market-place converted into a public
garden, surrounded at ends and one side by imposing government
buildings. On visiting the square where the old church
stood, the men of full beards and broad-brimmed soft hats now
look instead on beds of flowers in bloom and fountains casting
rainbow spray round a circular space.</p>

<p>One feels more comfortable in Pretoria after having spent
some time in the Gold City, for he has left the red dust behind,
the unattractive cyanide banks, the clouds of black smoke
and the sooty buildings. The air is free from smoke, from the
dirt banks, and a healthier atmosphere prevails. Pretoria is
Dutch; Johannesburg cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>Some 40,000 people were living in this attractive place, and
the population is increasing. The government departments
were removed from Capetown, one after another, and with the
reëstablishment of each Pretoria's population naturally increased
as the government employes followed. "Civil servants"
is the term used to denote government employes. An
increase in salaries was granted to employes when brought from
Capetown or Durban, as the salaries paid in the coast cities, on
which a frugal person could save money, provided little more
than food and clothing in the new capital. As in Johannesburg,
house rent is high, and board cannot be had at less than from
$35 to $40 a month. The cost of living here, as in Johannesburg,
is from 15 to 20 per cent. higher than the coast towns.</p>

<p>Away from mining towns smokestacks are few and far between.
Pretoria makes a better showing in this respect, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
there are flour mills, an ice plant, an electric power house, and
small manufactures that give the place a business appearance.</p>

<p>Walking a few blocks along West Kerk street, on the right
hand side, may be seen a one-story stone and cement house,
roofed with corrugated iron. This building is surrounded with
an iron fence, built on a cement foundation. On each side
of the walk leading to the house are two stone lions. In
front is a veranda. In that modest house Paul Kruger
lived. Walking in the same direction a few squares a park
is reached. Entering by a gate, a short distance ahead is
seen a large cement foundation with steps leading up, and
resting on the foundation is a square granite base. The monument
finishes there. Postcards bear a picture of the completed
monument to Paul Kruger, but it lacks the bronze figure of the
Boer President. "The monument that was to have been
erected to the memory of the late President Kruger" is the
wording under the picture of the "completed" monument.
The bronze figure of Paul Kruger reached Lourenzo Marques,
Portuguese East Africa, at the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer
War, in 1899. Several lean years followed the Boers' defeat,
and the Transvaal was theirs no longer. What stands of "the
monument that was to have been" is well looked after. Some
day, however, the printing on a postcard of the completed monument
will read: "Paul Kruger's Monument."</p>

<p>"Dick" Seddon, of New Zealand, was a great man; Brazil,
Argentine, Chile and Australia have produced men they consider
great, but their fame is only local. Many in other countries
tell one that the United States has produced but two great
men&mdash;Washington and Lincoln. Looking at things from a
world viewpoint, one cannot find a man born south of the
equator who measures up to Paul Kruger's fame. So, in fairness
to rugged genius, it would seem no overt act would be committed
if the completed monument did stand in that park in
Pretoria&mdash;to the memory of the greatest man born south of the
equator.</p>

<p>"Have you been out to Wonderboom?" is a question visitors
to Pretoria will be asked. Six or seven miles from the capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
is seen from a distance what looks like a very large tree, located
a mile from the railroad station. Big trees with dark green
leaves are rare on the veld, which accounts for Wonderboom
being such an attraction. In a radius of 150 feet seven groups
of trees are growing, and from each grows half a dozen trees.
The space taken up by some of these groups measures from 20
to 30 feet, and the clumps grow from roots of what appeared
to have been large trees at one time. When vegetation of all
sorts is white from drought the Wonderboom is as green as if
it had been watered at frequent intervals. The trees grow 20
feet high, and cover an area of half an acre. No one seemed to
know the name of the wood. "Vonderboom" seemed to be
sufficient to cover all questions asked about its specie.</p>

<p>English newspapers published in Pretoria could not be favorably
compared to the Johannesburg productions. This may be
accounted for by the existence of Dutch publications, which
naturally have a larger patronage than English newspapers, the
population being in the main Dutch. As a considerable amount
of the government printing is now done in Pretoria, this industry
has improved. The pay is from $30 to $45 a week,
eight hours' work. Mechanics of all kinds receive $5 a day.</p>

<p>All government documents, bills, blanks, etc., are printed
in two languages&mdash;Dutch and English. As the government
owns the railway, telegraph, postoffice and telephone systems,
any one can understand what a big item the government's
printing bill is. This was agreed to by the British representatives
who attended the convention at which the consolidation
of the four provinces was ratified. The Dutch adhere strictly
to this agreement affecting their language.</p>

<p>The Dutch are not a vindictive race. No tales of brutality
are heard of in connection with the Boer War. Men who
fought on the British side tell of having been taken prisoner
and of being sent back to their command. Sometimes the Boers
would take the clothes off a captive, and then direct him to
where his fellow soldiers were camped. Paul Kruger would
have been justified in shooting the men who instigated and took
part in the Jameson Raid, on the grounds of treason, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
spared their lives. They paid big sums of money in fines,
though, for their unsuccessful, treasonable offense.</p>

<p>The Dutch have their faults, like other races, but they seem
the better able to guide the destiny of their land of plagues.</p>

<p>The Boer War, in a sense, proved a blessing in disguise to
the Dutch. Previous to that time proper attention had not
been given to educating the young; precious few lawyers, doctors,
educators and mining engineers bore Dutch names. Look
through the directories of South Africa now and contrast the
number of Dutch names that figure among those of the professional
class. The war woke up the Boers to a sense of assuming
a greater responsibility in the advancement of their country.
A great many Dutch young men are students in the leading
universities of the world.</p>

<p>Nothing feminine in sound is noticeable about the names of
places in Boerland. But one often feels at a loss to account
for the general use of the affix "fontein." Save for a narrow
strip along the coast the country is dry. The Orange and the
Vaal rivers seem to be the only two of consequence in the interior.
The country is full of "spruits," "fonteins" and
rivers which, when one reaches them, are dry as a bone. The
only things that seem to "spruit" in them are cobble-stones and
rattle-snakes.</p>

<p>"Assegaiboschfontein," "Jakhalskraalfontein," "Wildebeestespruitbult"
are a few names of towns that occur to one as
being decidedly masculine.</p>

<p>Boers, physically, are large men. Many of the older men
wear full beards, and invariably wear a broad-brimmed hat with
cloth band of several plies thick. They smoke calabash pipes,
the weed being known as Boer tobacco, which costs 50 cents a
pound. They generally carry a sjambok, a strip of rhinoceros
hide about three feet long and an inch thick. Meeting one
alone, the questions he asks in quick succession&mdash;"What's your
name?" "Where do you come from?" "What's your business?"
"Have you been in South Africa long?" "How
long are you going to stay in the country?"&mdash;bring to mind
this distinguishing trait of a noted Chinese who made a visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
America some years ago. Rum is the Boer's strong drink, but
he is seldom seen under the influence of liquor. In a sense, he
is of a roaming disposition, for some Boers are on the trek all
the time. They seem to be better suited when they have got
beyond the outposts of civilization. Were it not for the Boer's
inclination to trek, however, it is possible there would be no gold
mines on the Rand or diamond fields in Kimberley. His battles
with the native tribes and his sufferings and hardships will
never be lost sight of as the factors through which the white
man was enabled to live in that section of "Darkest Africa."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>We take our departure from the Transvaal and make a start
for Victoria Falls, in Rhodesia, also British territory. Traveling
some 300 miles out of a direct line, through Fourteen
Streams, to Vryburg, on to Mafeking, finds us nearly opposite
the place started from, but headed in the right direction. A
gap of 40 miles from Zeerust to the main line has since been
closed, which makes the trip from Johannesburg to Bulawayo
much shorter. Two trains a week care for all the business
over that stretch of native territory.</p>

<p>From Fourteen Streams, which is only a railway junction,
we start northward over the treeless veld on our way to Rhodesia,
700 miles beyond. Vryburg is the next place reached
where white people live, and most of the 3,000 inhabitants are
engaged in business connected with farming. Nearly a hundred
miles further Mafeking was reached, which has been made historical
in virtue of the seven-months' siege of Britishers during
the Boer War. It is located near the Transvaal border, and is
a trading center for the western Transvaal. Railway car shops
are located at Mafeking, and these and the trading industries
give employment to its 3,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>An hour's ride further, and we have crossed the Cape Colony-Bechuanaland
Protectorate border line. Northward from
that point we pass through what seems an uninhabited country,
so far as white people are concerned. A railway station is built
here and there along the line, where a few Europeans may be
seen; but the country is wild and populated with natives. Were
one to go to sleep for six or eight hours, upon waking up he
would not know that he had moved a mile, so far as any change
in the appearance of the landscape would indicate. At a few
stations signs of industry were in evidence, bags of corn being
piled along the track.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>Natives with karosses (skins of wild beasts) and native-made
souvenirs surrounded the train when stops were made, spreading
their wares on the ground and holding the objects of native
handicraft to the gaze of the passengers. The natives' souvenirs
were the images of giraffes, elephants, lions, tigers, storks and
other animals cut out of wood and painted or dyed black, but
many of the imitations were far from good. Splendid karosses
are bought cheap along the line. One can have his choice of a
lion, tiger, hyena, jackal, wildcat, monkey and baboon, and
sometimes a giraffe. Many are as large as a buffalo robe.</p>

<p>"How much!" shouted a splendid specimen of a Bechuana
woman, in the native language, as she held her naked pickaninny
over her head&mdash;laughing heartily at the same time&mdash;at a
place where the train had stopped and where natives and karosses
were numerous. Passengers were bartering and haggling
with the natives over the price of karosses, and others were
ambitious to sell their souvenirs. The black mother had imbibed
the "shopping" spirit, when she jocularly offered her
babe for sale. "Half a crown!" (60 cents) shouted a passenger.
With that offer the semi-barbarous mother quickly
brought her pickaninny to her bosom, threw her arms about the
little one and gave it such a hug that the baby's eyes bulged, she
laughing so heartily the while as if to split her sides.</p>

<p>Still traveling toward the heart of Africa, we reach Mochudi
and the Kalahari Desert, the eastern fringe of which we traverse,
a distance of 200 miles. The dust had become so thick
in this stretch of the journey that the color of the passengers'
clothes could not be detected. All the way along from Mafeking
I could not keep from my mind the Americanism, "It's
a great country, where nobody lives and dogs bark at strangers."</p>

<p>When the train stopped at Mahalapye we entered what is
known as Khama's country. The course of the railroad is
nearly on the line taken by David Livingstone, the explorer.
When Livingstone and his band passed through that section
of Africa, the grandfather of the reigning chief offered every
hospitality to the explorer, and espoused the Christian religion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Chief Khama, the grandson, is the most important ruler of
Bechuanaland, and has spent some time in Europe; he conforms
largely to European customs. Besides being a strict
disciplinarian, he forbids the sale of liquor to his people. He
receives a pension from the English Government. Serowe,
Khama's capital, located 30 miles inland from Palapye Road
station, is the largest town in Bechuanaland, having a population
of 40,000. His subjects pay the smallest head tax of any
of the tribes in South Africa.</p>

<p>We were passing through a country about which the wildebeeste,
gemsbuck, eland, tiger, lion, and even the giraffe, still
roam. Along the railway may be seen the secretary bird, guinea
fowl and also handsome cranes. The secretary bird, so named
from feathers growing at the back of the head, which look like
quill pens, is what is known as "royal game." "Royal game"
are beasts or fowl that must not be killed. The reason the
secretary bird is protected is because it is a bitter foe to snakes.
Snatching a snake in the middle with his bill, he at once begins
to fly upward with the reptile, and when at a certain height
will let go his prey. The snake, when he strikes the earth, is
killed.</p>

<p>White traders are located through these desolate tracts of
country, sometimes a hundred miles from a railway. Little
cash changes hands between natives and traders in out-of-the-way
districts. For his skins and corn, or whatever the native
may have to sell, he receives as pay bright-colored calico, Jew's-harps,
concertinas, mouth organs, tinware and such things.</p>

<p>Passing out of Khama's country we enter a territory known
as the Tati Concessions. Traversing this tract, we crossed the
northern boundary of Bechuanaland a few miles south of Plumtree,
when we were in Matabeleland, Rhodesia. In this section
Lobengula, the Matabele king, held undisputed sway until
Cecil Rhodes decided to annex this part of Africa to England's
possessions. What Andries Pretorius did to Dingaan at Blood
River&mdash;broke forever the power of the Zulus&mdash;Cecil Rhodes
did with the powerful Lobengula in Matabeleland.</p>

<p>We passed within ten miles of the Matopo Hills, on the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of which is buried Cecil John Rhodes, "the Colossus of South
Africa," as he was termed. Whatever shortcomings Rhodes
may have possessed, or the means he resorted to to attain
his ambition, one of his virtues will always remain unquestioned&mdash;bravery.
He wished his remains to rest where
his greatest feat of daring took place. It was during
the rebellion of the Matabeles in 1896-97 that Rhodes, unarmed,
with a friend accompanying him, walked up the Matopos
through the files of the warring hordes of blacks to where
their chiefs were stationed. His cool bravery and personal
magnetism so impressed the chiefs that the rebellion ceased.</p>

<p>"Here lie the remains of Cecil John Rhodes" is the brief inscription
carved on a granite slab that covers his grave, which
was chiseled out of a solid rock on the highest of the Matopo
Hills. "World's View" is the name Rhodes gave the place
where he is buried. It is located 30 miles southeast of Bulawayo.</p>

<p>Bulawayo, meaning in English "the place of killing," is located
in the heart of wildest Africa. We find here splendid
streets, as wide as those of Salt Lake City, fringed with trees,
with monuments erected at convenient places in the center; a
good public library, containing 5,000 volumes; hospitals, parks,
a botanical garden, zoölogical park, museum and art gallery,
schools, churches, business buildings, daily newspapers&mdash;all of
a high order. Bulawayo, nearly 1,400 miles from Capetown,
has a population of 5,000 whites. It is the largest town of
Matabeleland, the center of the gold mining industry, and has
had railway connection with the Transvaal since 1897. Only
four years earlier Lobengula's Kraal occupied the land that
Bulawayo is built on. It required the sacrifice of many lives
of hardy frontiersman to conquer the Matabeles, and to pave
the way for the accession of Matabeleland, Mashonaland,
Barotseland and the other sections that comprise Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Industries in Bulawayo are few and small. In this respect,
however, it is no different than most African towns. But located
in the country away from the metropolis are numerous
gold mines, and Bulawayo is headquarters for that industry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
The annual output from these mines run from $12,000,000 to
$15,000,000.</p>

<p>We find in this place the typical frontiersmen. This feature
of the country is reflected from its founder, as Rhodes was not
a "toff." Every one goes in his shirtsleeves, and derby hats
are not sold in Bulawayo. Soft, wide-brimmed hats, like those
worn by the Boers, rule the day. One occasionally sees the
butt of a revolver sticking out of a hip pocket or at the side of
a belt, and hunting knives, incased in a sheath, are carried by
almost every one, particularly on leaving town. A rifle strapped
over the shoulder of men coming in from country districts is a
common thing to see. Lions and tigers are so numerous in
Rhodesia that weapons are carried to protect one's-self from any
attack that might be made by the wild beasts. Still, under these
"trouble-making" conditions, we find maintained that same
respect for law and order that was so noticeable in other parts.</p>

<p>A native word&mdash;"indaba"&mdash;much in use in Rhodesia, is
often used in South Africa. When the chiefs met to talk over
matters pertaining to their tribe&mdash;a native cabinet meeting&mdash;the
meeting would be termed an "indaba." When Cecil
Rhodes was engaged in dissuading the Matabele chiefs on the
Matopo hill to discontinue the rebellion, the meeting of the
"great white chief" with the native chiefs was termed an
"indaba."</p>

<p>In the grounds of Government House stands what is known
as the "Indaba Tree." The residence of the Governor-General
is built on the site of Lobengula's home, and it was under
this tree that the rulers of the Matabele tribe assembled and
dispensed native justice.</p>

<p>Though the altitude of Matabeleland is about 5,000 feet, the
weather is warmer in winter than it is in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of "salted" cattle in South Africa.
The only people who can live in most parts of Rhodesia are
"salted" men. If the inhabitants are so fortunate as to take
on a few pounds of flesh at certain seasons, they lose that much,
and generally more, from fever and ague at another season.
Among the creditable buildings mentioned of Bulawayo was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
included "good hospitals." Wherever hospitals are seen frequently,
particularly in small settlements, one is using sound
judgment if he makes his escape from that place early, as otherwise
he will soon be personally familiar with the interior of these
institutions. Wherever hospital facilities of a small community
are of the first order, one finds a graveyard out of all
proportion to the number of people who live in the place. A
hen with a brood of chicks was crossing a sidewalk in Bulawayo,
and each chick had its head drawn back between its wings.
They were so slow getting across the walk that one had to step
over them&mdash;stepping over chunks of fever, as it were.</p>

<p>Rhodesia is a trap in which many poor men get caught. The
riches of the country are much advertised in England, and
those who come out and buy land soon find that their limited
means are gone, and they are practically stranded. Both
Rhodesia and South Africa are countries only for men with
capital.</p>

<p>The railway branches in two directions from Bulawayo&mdash;one
easterly to Salisbury and out to Beira, Portuguese East
Africa, the latter place being the port for Rhodesia; and northwesterly
to Victoria Falls, and from that point 300 miles northward
toward the southern border of the Congo Free State.
This branch is what is known as the Cape-to-Cairo route.</p>

<p>We will start for the Falls. Fifty miles from Bulawayo
we left the plains and passed through a forest of teak trees.
Further on, growing palms indicated a warmer climate.</p>

<p>"Thirteen years ago," said a traveling companion, who was
a trader in these parts, "fourteen of us came up to Rhodesia.
None was over 25 years of age. I'm the only one left out
of the fourteen," he concluded. Asked what had taken off his
companions, he answered: "One was killed by a lion, and
the others died of fever."</p>

<p>Ho! a smokestack is in view. We have reached Wankie, a
coal mining district, and a rich one, too, for the mineral may
be seen cropping out of the ground on each side of the track.
A big hospital is observed, situated on a hill, which bears the
usual significance in Rhodesia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you see that low, white cloud to the right?" asked a
passenger. "That's the spray from Victoria Falls. We have
several miles yet to go before we reach the bridge," he
added.</p>

<p>We had traveled 1,200 miles from Johannesburg to this
place, the journey taking three days. Recklessness, rather than
good judgment, marked my course, for railroad fare from and
back to Johannesburg tapped my purse for $100. Expenses on
the train had increased also, as the cheapest meal from Mafeking
north was 60 cents, and the next cheapest 75 cents. But
to one whose mind inclines to seeing the acme of nature's handicraft,
promptings of this character outweigh financial considerations.
Hotel accommodation at Victoria Falls was correspondingly
high&mdash;$5 a day. One has no choice, as there
is but a single hotel there, which is the property of the railroad
company. Aside from the hotel, a photographer's studio
and a few houses comprise all there is in the way of buildings
in Victoria Falls.</p>

<p>Some of the Boers who took part in the Great Trek from
Capetown north in 1835-38 did not stop long in what later
became the Transvaal, but kept trekking, until they reached the
Zambezi River. Most of these voortrekkers, however, were
massacred by Matabeles. This occurred from ten to fifteen
years earlier than Livingstone's visit. But it fell to David
Livingstone to make known to the world the greatest of waterfalls,
on which he first set eyes in November, 1855.</p>

<p>For a distance of seven miles above the falls the river is
dotted with evergreen islands. Through this archipelago the
waters of the Zambezi slowly run, giving no intimation of
what is taking place several miles below. On these islands hippopotami
feed when inclination prompts, and crocodiles sun
themselves and sleep when they choose land to water rest.</p>

<p>Two islands&mdash;Livingstone and Cataract&mdash;are located at
the edge of the precipice, which accounts for Victoria Falls
being of three parts, namely: Rainbow, Main and Cataract
Falls. The distance from one side of the river to the other
here is over a mile&mdash;5,808 feet, to be correct. The water, unlike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
that of Niagara, is of a dark, sallow color, but not muddy,
and the falls are straight, instead of horseshoe shape.</p>

<p>Stealthily the water moves over the wide ledge of rock,
when its dull, lifeless color in the archipelago now assumes a
much brighter shade. Save for two dark panels of unwatered
space, made by two green islands just above, there unfolds before
the visitor's eye what seems a mile-wide mantle of amber-colored,
gauze-like lace. Myriads of water crystals dart from
the broad flow's filmy web and, jewel-like, embellish the absorbing
water spread for a depth of 380 feet. Also rainbows
revel in still further enhancing this crowning masterpiece of art&mdash;these,
in beautifying, sharing a radiant part&mdash;the bars of
iris, of lustrous, engrossing hues, burnishing the peerless tri-falls'
breast, as the veil-like flow descends in brilliant, multi-colored,
wavy folds from its smooth, extended crest to the
roaring, misty maw below. Clouds of spray, which may be
seen 15 miles away, rise to a height of 2,000 feet from the
boiling abyss, and the thunderous roar made by the impact of
the waters is heard 12 miles beyond.</p>

<p>A parallel wall rises in front of the precipice over which the
water flows. A space varying from 80 to 240 feet separates the
two. Into this narrow chasm 5,000,000 gallons of water a
minute dash from a height of 380 feet, and one may imagine
what pandemonium is taking place all the time in the great
vault. For three-quarters of a mile the second, or parallel,
wall, runs westward, unbroken. Then there is a break of
something like 200 feet in width, that looks as if it had
been gnarled out not only by water, but that even some other
powerful agency had taken part in making this cleavage. The
wall rises again to its full height and maintains a solid, unbroken
front for a quarter of a mile further to Cataract Falls,
at the west bank of the river. The water from Rainbow Falls,
at the east bank, and from Main Falls, in the center of the
river, runs westward to the 200-foot gap in the parallel wall,
and the water from Cataract Falls runs eastward and, boiling
and foaming, intermixes with the other waters and flows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
through the same opening. One may form an idea of the great
depth of water at the narrow outlet when it is borne in mind
that this vast quantity, falling over a ledge of rock a mile wide,
finds its way out of the huge rock tank through that narrow
channel.</p>

in height to the precipice over which the water passes, the picture
being drawn with a view of affording a clearer conception of Victoria's
wide descent.</p>
</div>

<p>After the water storms through the 200-foot wide channel
the torrent travels several hundred feet, when it flows under
the Zambezi railway bridge, 450 feet above. On it turbulently
runs, the water befoamed, through high, perpendicular
walls of basaltic rock for over a mile. The rocky banks then
decrease, but the course of the river remains rugged and tortuous
for a distance of 40 miles.</p>

<p>Vegetation growing about the falls, particularly palm trees,
adds much attractiveness to the environment. The absence of
improvements&mdash;save for the bridge, together with grass-thatched
native huts showing dimly through the vegetation on
the banks; the evergreen islands; the stillness of the water before
making its plunge, contrasted with the wild-appearing,
rugged, high, rocky walls below and the foaming and billowy
torrent as it dashes madly through the narrow gorge&mdash;make
Victoria, like other great works of nature, distinctive in formation
from other notable waterfalls.</p>

<p>Summing up the comparative grandeur and greatness of
Niagara and Victoria Falls, most persons who have seen both
would decide, I believe, that Niagara Falls is the more beautiful
and Victoria the greater. In this connection one has only
to compare the grand crescent of sky-blue water of Niagara
with the dull color of Victoria Falls, the water of Niagara, after
plunging over an unbroken stretch of rock ledge into a roomy,
circular-shaped basin, assuming its true blue color, with the
gradual narrowing of the banks to the Gorge; contrast Niagara's
broad, sweeping, unconfined character with the water of
the Zambezi, hemmed in from view in tank-like walls after
passing over the falls, and then prevented from making a good
showing, as it were, by a continuation of similar walls for a
distance of 40 miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>The bridge across the Zambezi River is a pretty one, with
a single span of 610 feet, and was constructed by an American
firm. Cecil Rhodes instructed the builders to erect it where
it now stands, "so that it would always be wet by spray from
the falls."</p>

<p>Nature's fickleness, a trait disclosed in choosing remote regions
for some of her noted wonders, entailing, as it does, long
journeys, fatigue and much expense to reach, is conspicuous by
her placing Victoria in a country hemmed in on the west by
Angola and German West Africa, north by the Belgian Congo,
northeast by German East Africa, east by Portuguese East
Africa, and south by Bechuanaland and the Transvaal. The
shortest time in which a journey could be made from an American
port to these falls is about five weeks. Landing at Capetown,
four days' travel, on a slow train, mostly over a dry and
dusty country, must be undergone to reach that point, when
Victoria Falls is viewed in all its sublimity, located in a wild,
interesting, but fever-ridden, section of Rhodesia, where only a
handful of languid white persons live, and on a continent where
the superior race number less than a million and a half.</p>

<p>It is dangerous to cross the Zambezi River in a rowboat, the
river being infested with crocodiles, which grow from 12 to 16
feet long. The hippopotamus, though, starts the trouble. He
hides just under the water, and nothing can be seen of the beast
until a boat is on top of him. Then he rises, overturning the
boat. "Hippo" will not harm a person in the water; but
crocodiles are generally found close to a hippopotamus, and the
former are always hungry. As soon as the unfortunate occupants
of a boat have been dumped overboard there is a swirl
of water close by, another farther off, yet more disturbed water,
when long, dull colored shapes come lashing swiftly up. The
poor swimmers disappear, the muddy water reddens for a short
time, and then becomes sallow colored again. To the Barotse
native the crocodile is a sacred animal, and, as he will not harm
the voracious beasts, deaths of both natives and Europeans by
crocodiles occur frequently in this part of Rhodesia.</p>

<p>The Zambezi River rises in West Portuguese Africa and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
empties into the Indian Ocean at Chinde, Portuguese East Africa,
about a thousand miles from its source.</p>

<p>Beer and whiskey are drunk a great deal in that part of
Rhodesia, and almost every one takes quinine to allay fever.
No one would dare take a drink of water were it not boiled.</p>

<p>"Knocking around" is a term much in use in Rhodesia.
"Have you seen John Smith knocking around?" "Is there
a boat knocking around?" "Are there lions knocking around
here?" are common instances in which the term is used.</p>

<p>Tigers are so numerous about Victoria Falls that they rob
hen roosts, and even climb through pantry windows and take
away what eatables are handy.</p>

<p>Vegetation in these parts is interesting to visitors, as all
the bushes and trees are strange to those coming from foreign
places. Nearly every tree or shrub produces its seed in the form
of a pod, like beans. Thorn prongs, as sharp as needles and
two and three inches in length, grow on some trees. The
cream-of-tartar tree, however, will interest a visitor more.
This one grows very large, and the bark is the color of a
hippopotamus' skin. In fact, the bark of all trees has a dark
color. The pod of the cream-of-tartar is the shape of a cucumber
and 10 to 12 inches long. The shell is very hard, but,
when broken open, if ripe, the substance in the pod is white,
and separates from the fibers in the form of sugar cubes. The
natives eat it. One cream-of-tartar tree seen close to the falls
measured 22 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>A very good tribe of natives is found in that part of Rhodesia&mdash;the
Barotse. At a kraal visited, several of the sightseers
asked a native for a drink of native beer. The liquid was
brought in a large calabash, and the drinking cup was the
bowled-out end of a small calabash. Before the native served
the beer he poured out some of the brew in the hollow of his
hand and drank it. Then he tilted the vegetable demijohn,
when the beer was poured into the cup for the Europeans. The
reason of the Barotse sampling the beer first was to allay any
suspicion his white visitors might entertain concerning its genuineness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Natives' musical instruments are a one-string fiddle, a skin
drum, and a little wooden frame containing three and four
pieces of steel a quarter of an inch in width and four inches in
length. This last is called a "piano." The small strips of
steel are fastened at one end of the frame. By touching these
with the fingers a faint musical sound is produced. For hours
at a time a husky native keeps playing the "piano," happy in the
thought that he is an accomplished pianist. Lewanika is the
head chief of the Barotse tribe.</p>

<p>Native wives are much cheaper in Barotseland than in Zululand,
prices ranging from two sheep to ten cows. Should the
wife leave her husband&mdash;elope, for instance&mdash;the girl's father
must return the sheep or cows to the deserted husband.</p>

<p>North of the Zambezi River the territory is known as Northwestern
Rhodesia, and also Barotseland. Seven miles from
Victoria Falls is located Livingstone, the capital of Northwestern
Rhodesia. Here, right in the heart of one of the
fever regions of Africa, one finds small but substantial provincial
buildings, a good, roomy hotel, an up-to-date printing office,
and a small but interesting botanical garden.</p>

<p>Malarial, or African, fever is very bad at Livingstone.
Horses and cattle cannot live in this part of Rhodesia unless
they are well "salted." Everything must be "salted," both
man and beast. Transport riders, when taking a load of provisions
to traders or to mining camps located far from the
railway, are provided with extra oxen. Lions are so numerous
it frequently occurs that an ox is found in the morning dead
and partly eaten, the work of Leo during the night while the
cattle were resting or grazing. It is said the vital part of the
cattle where the lion makes his attack is the nose. In a second
the beast is thrown, and it is but a matter of a few minutes when
the lion will have his prey dead and badly torn.</p>

<p>The tsetse fly is in his own bailiwick in these parts. This
fly is one of the worst plagues of Central Africa. In size, this
insect is as large as a bumblebee, and when he bites he draws
blood, whether it be man or beast. It is said the deadly virus
he injects is extracted from the bodies of big wild game.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Nagana is the name of the disease caused by the tsetse-fly bite.
The scientific name for this fly is rather prosy&mdash;Glossina
morsitans; also for a first cousin, whose bite likewise caused
nagana disease, Glossina allidipes. Mail must be carried to
the interior by immune native runners, as a bite from these flies
means a very short life for a horse. Deaths from sleeping
sickness have occurred in this section of Africa.</p>

<p>Machillas are the means of transportation by which people
are carried from place to place. The machilla is a long pole,
with the ends of a piece of canvas made fast, over which a cover
is stretched. The ends of the pole rest on the shoulders of
four natives&mdash;eight in all&mdash;who run along at a good gait,
with their passengers in the hammock-like device, until they
reach a relay station&mdash;at intervals of about five miles&mdash;when
a fresh "team" of natives take up the machilla and are off
again at a good trot.</p>

<p>The European population of this large tract of land is said to
be only 30,000, blacks numbering 150 to one white person&mdash;and
it is doubtful if that number will ever be greater, for the
large graveyards with numerous fresh mounds of dirt are
becoming better known through the receipt of mail by friends
living in countries of the North sent by cadaverous, shaking
relatives dying in the fever glades of Rhodesia.</p>

<p>From Livingstone, 1,650 miles north of Capetown, the projected
Cape-to-Cairo line extends 300 miles further, to Broken
Hill, where it stops. The route from here is to the southern
borderline of the Belgian Congo, thence through that country,
crossing the equator, until Uganda is reached. From Uganda
it will traverse the Soudan, running thence into southern Egypt.
At a point in this country the line will connect with a tongue
extending southward from Cairo, the northern terminus.
When the center has been linked, the length of the line from
Capetown, the southern terminus, to Cairo, will be about 5,000
miles.</p>

<p>Returning to Johannesburg, we passed through Bulawayo,
then over the Matabeleland borderline into Bechuanaland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
through the Kalahari Desert, next into Cape Colony, and thus
into Boerland.</p>

<p>Perhaps the prettiest and most shapely mountains in the
world are those in South Africa. Though not so high as those
in other countries, their shapeliness attracts, most of them
bearded with brush at bases and sides, the tops being round
and grassy. With the deep blue sky above&mdash;the sun nearly
always shining on the high veld, except during a shower of
rain&mdash;and the same colored horizon all round, together with
the rays from a bright sun lavishly diffusing the summits, there
is a tone and finish to Boerland mountains which, in other
countries, rocks, snow and timber do not bestow. The highest
mountain is Mount Aux Sources, rising 10,000 feet, located in
the Drakensburg range.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>From the Gold City we traveled southward to the Diamond
City.</p>

<p>"You haven't been in town long?" a Kimberley policeman
addressing me, remarked, as he stepped in front. As a matter
of fact, I had only got about a hundred yards from the railway
station. I surmised that I had been taken for an "I. D. B." (illicit diamond buyer), having been told a bird can scarcely
alight in Kimberley without coming under police surveillance.
"We're from the same country, I believe," the officer continued,
when I felt easier. "My native town is St. Louis," he added.
"Come to my home this afternoon and have dinner with us,
after which we'll call on an American living in a house a few
doors below," he went on kindly. This courtesy allayed all
suspicion that I would be asked to establish my identity before
staying longer in the diamond fields. The invitation was accepted,
his hospitality being generous. The second American
had been on the diamond fields for more than 30 years, but local
interest was a secondary consideration to meeting some one just
come from the United States. He had been in British territory
so long that he had acquired the British accent, but that was the
only thing foreign about him, as one would not know where to
find a more patriotic son of America. On a second visit to
the "Diamond City" every kindness was shown me by these
two "exiles."</p>

<p>Kimberley, with a population of about 35,000, one-third of
this number being white, is the capital of Griqualand West, a
section of Cape Colony. Before diamonds were discovered, the
territory embraced in the Kimberley district was understood to
be a part of the Orange Free State. When the diamond fields
promised rich returns, Cape Colony officials claimed this tract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
as being part of that province. The matter was finally adjusted
by the Free State surrendering its claim to the Cape authorities
upon payment by the latter to the Boer republic of
several million dollars. The Diamond City has evidently stood
still while other places in the sub-continent have kept pace with
the progress of the times. Its newspapers are inferior; only
one building reaches three stories; there is very little street
paving, practically no sidewalks, and public buildings are quite
ordinary; the shacks standing not far from the business center,
built by colored people out of American oil cans, are a disgrace;
church bells even are suspended from a crosspiece resting on the
top of two posts, 10 feet high, in the churchyard; the parks do
not amount to much, most of the shade trees in these being fine-bearded
pine, through which the sun beats down on one. If
there was anything of a creditable character here, save for a
modern street car system, we did not observe it. To Alexandriafontein,
a fenced-in private pleasure resort, an electric
line runs, but it costs 25 cents to reach this park.</p>

<p>Were one in need of an object lesson to understand thoroughly
what a trust means to a municipality, he would learn
that lesson in Kimberley. A number of diamond mines are in
operation in the Kimberley district, but there is but one diamond
mining company&mdash;the De Beers. Diamond mining is the only
industry in Kimberley. Mine officials are very kind to visitors
who wish to look about the works.</p>

<p>"Ho! that's Kimberley rain," shouted a friend. Looking
from a window, the width of the street appeared a solid mass
of dust, if the term may be allowed, extending far above the
roofs of the houses. "That's the sort of 'rain' we get in
Kimberley," he explained. No rain had fallen for six months.</p>

<p>The depth of the diamond mines runs from 1,000 to 2,600
feet. The color of the soil in which the diamonds are found is
blue&mdash;blue dirt, it is called&mdash;which is removed by explosives.
Dirt, pebbles and stones are moved in iron trucks with iron
covers, and locked. On coming to the surface it is started on
gravity railways which extend from two to four miles from the
mine. The truck of dirt, weighing about a ton and containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
an average of one-third of a karat of diamond, is here
dumped on the ground. The "dirt field" contains 1,400 acres
of space. Three high barbed wire fences form the inclosure,
and police&mdash;mounted, on bicycles, and on foot&mdash;see that no
stranger gets inside the triple barbed-wire fence.</p>

<p>The blue dirt remains in the field from three to six months
until, by exposure to the air, it crumbles. A harrow, with
teeth 10 inches long, is drawn over the section of field ready for
use, when any remaining lumps are broken into fine dirt. The
diamond soil is next loaded into trucks and started back to the
head of the mine. The dirt is here dumped into a revolving
screen, which contains holes for pebbles of certain sizes to drop
through. These drop into a revolving round tank, or vat, 14
feet in diameter and about a foot deep, into which water runs.
Inside the vat are two large stationary rakes, around which the
tank revolves. This is called the washery. The dirt runs out
as muddy water, and the rakes serve to move the pebbles to a
point in the circular vat where there is an opening. Connecting
with this opening is a pipe, down which the stones pass into
a steel truck below. When the truck is filled with pebbles, the
door is closed and locked.</p>

<p>The truck is now started on a gravity railway to what is
called the pulsator, where the nuggets and diamond-bearing
stones are separated from those of no value. Here the contents
of the truck also are emptied into a revolving screen with
graduated holes to allow the pebbles to drop out. The stones
of the various sizes now drop into compartments 4 feet long and
18 inches wide&mdash;called jigs&mdash;which move back and forth.
Water runs over the pebbles in the jigs, the light-weight ones
washing out and the heavier remaining at the bottom. The
pebbles that remain in the jigs are taken out later and put into
still another revolving screen. Under the grade sizes of this
screen are inclined tables, over which water runs, these having
a thickly greased floor, or bottom, on to which the stones drop.
The nuggets and diamond-bearing stones stick in the grease,
but the non-diamondiferous pebbles pass over. To emphasize
how strongly grease acts as a magnet to the precious stones, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the millions and millions of pebbles that are washed over the
greased bottoms, which are carefully inspected by experts, rarely
is a diamond detected among the culls.</p>

<p>The little lumps on the greased tables&mdash;the diamonds covered
with grease&mdash;might resemble a hand with big warts.
The table is cleaned, when the scrapings are treated by a liquid,
which renders the diamonds free of grease. They then pass to
a sorting room. The sorters are native prisoners, but a white
man is over them. Then one negro, very expert in detecting
diamonds, examines the stones sorted by the prisoners. From
him they pass to a room where two white men again examine
them. They are then put into steel cups little larger than a
teacup. The cup has a lid to it and a lock. The lid is closed,
locked, and the cup labeled. The locked cups next go to the
Kimberley office. Every Monday the output of the diamond
mines is taken to a train headed for Capetown. That train
makes connection with a steamship leaving for Europe on
Wednesdays. From England most of the diamonds are sent to
Amsterdam, Holland, to be refined.</p>

<p>The reducing character of the diamond mining industry is
apt to astonish one. Over 200,000 trucks of dirt are treated
daily, and the product from this great quantity of soil is less
than a cubic foot. Twenty-three thousand men are engaged
in digging, and the diamonds mined by that large force are
examined by but four eyes and handled by only four hands in the
examining room at the pulsator. The yearly output of the
Kimberley diamond mines is from $35,000,000 to $40,000,000.</p>

<p>Credit for bringing to light the first stone found in the
Kimberley district, in 1870, is given to an Irishman named
O'Reilly. A Dutch boy, whose father's name was Van Niekerk,
was playing jackstones. O'Reilly's eye being attracted
by a bright stone among those with which the boy was playing,
he told the boy's father he thought that particular one was a
diamond. O'Reilly's judgment proved to be good, as, when
weighed, it was found to be of 22½ karat. The stone was
sold for $2,500, O'Reilly and Van Niekerk dividing the
money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>On the wagon containing the weekly output of diamonds of
the Kimberley mines, and which meets the train that goes to
Capetown every Monday afternoon, is seated a white man and
a native driver. No attempt has yet been made to rob the
wagon while going from the head office of the diamond company
to the railway station. This alone may serve to emphasize
the grip which law and order has on that community.</p>

<p>A week before a native quits the diamond mines he is kept
under strict surveillance. The natives live in compounds, as
the kafirs do in the Rand mine compounds, but, unlike the
"boys" working in the gold mines, mine "boys" of Kimberley
are not allowed outside of the compound except when going
to and coming from work, and then only under guard. They
are hired for from three months to a year, and are paid from
$15 to $30 a month and board. There are seven mines in the
Kimberley district, which give employment to 20,000 natives
and 3,000 Europeans. Three eight-hour shifts are worked.</p>

<p>Those engaged in the diamond diggings along the banks of
the River Vaal carry with them during life a characteristic by
which they may be picked out from among men following different
pursuits. A fortune&mdash;which they all hope for&mdash;may
escape them if their eyes are raised from the ground for even so
brief a time as that required for the wink of an eyelash, as they
might thus have missed the fleeting flash of a precious stone just
peeping through the soil. For this reason, when engaged in
the diamond diggings their eyes are constantly looking downward.
After they leave the diggings&mdash;when they have spent
their savings and become practically starved out&mdash;they walk
about with bent head, looking at the sidewalk or ground as they
did when hand-screening soil and digging alluvial dirt. Some
have made fortunes in the diggings, but these are few and far
between.</p>

<p>Bloemfontein, next visited, is known as the Convention City.
Because of its location, being the most important city in the
center of South Africa and well provided with hotels and railway
connections, together with its good public buildings, it
has become the favored place for national gatherings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>After the Boer War the name of this province was changed
to Orange River Colony, against the burghers' wishes. In
May, 1910, when the Dutch again assumed power, its former
name, and its present one&mdash;Orange Free State&mdash;again came
into use.</p>

<p>Located between hills on two sides, having good streets, shady
walks, electric light, good buildings, and a broad, treeless veld
to the east, with poverty seemingly absent, an inviting air pervades
Bloemfontein. The homes of that city, a great many of
them built of red brick, with their vari-colored painted roofs
and tidy yards filled with flowers, all nestling under and some
built on the side of the kopjes, or hills, put one in mind of
that other Dutch capital&mdash;Pretoria. Unlike Kimberley, no
tin shanties were to be seen here, neither were the streets swarming
with half-castes and Hindus.</p>

<p>As in other places in South Africa where there are no mines,
smokestacks are few here. The Orange Free State is said to
be a good farming section, and from that source, and the general
commercial and official business linked with a metropolis and
State capital, spring the main assets of the city. Newspapers,
a good gauge by which to measure a center, are in advance of
the Free State capital.</p>

<p>The marketplace in Bloemfontein is typical of the Dutch,
being located in the center of the town, business houses and
hotels standing on the four sides. The long ox teams, led by
natives with rawhide strips tied to the horns of the leading
yoke; the big transport, with its tent at the rear, a Boer sitting
in the doorway or opening, smoking his calabash pipe filled with
Boer tobacco, and his frau, behind him, knitting; the auctioneers
jabbering above a pile of farm produce; the group of farmers,
with their wide-brimmed hats and full beards, arguing in the
Dutch language, are all in evidence. It was interesting to walk
about observing the product of the soil and the people who cultivate
it, and the means in use to bring it where it might be profitably
sold. With the tent at the rear end of the transport, and
"scoff," coffee and cooking utensils, hotel expenses are eliminated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and one may stay as long as one wishes. A great number
of Boers pay a couple of days' visit to old acquaintances
when they come to this marketplace.</p>

<p>Bi-lingualism, a nightmare to some of the British in South
Africa, has its fountainhead in Bloemfontein. Bi-lingualism
here means the teaching of the Dutch and English languages in
the public schools. When the conditions of consolidation were
drafted, dual languages&mdash;Dutch and English&mdash;to be taught
in schools was one of the provisions, and this clause was agreed
to by the British representatives at the convention at which
the act of federation was ratified. The Minister of Education
is from the Orange Free State, and is Dutch through and
through. He insists on the dual language clause being carried
out to the letter. The Dutch, as spoken in South Africa&mdash;it
is called the Taal&mdash;is not so pure as the Holland Dutch.
While one might not agree with the Minister of Education in
forcing English scholars to study Dutch, when either French,
Spanish or German would be better, his fighting for the perpetuation
of his mother tongue must command admiration.
Cabinet Ministers of South Africa, by the way, are not cheap
salaried men. The Premier receives $70,000 a year, the other
members $48,000 a year.</p>

<p>Hotel expenses are from $3 to $5 a day. House rent is
rather high, too; but the wages paid mechanics are fair, running
from $4 to $5 a day.</p>

<p>In the evening one sees very few black people about the
streets. Bloemfontein has a municipal "location"&mdash;a place
where natives must live&mdash;about three miles from town. Except
as a servant, the Indian coolie, although a British subject,
is not allowed to cross the Free State border. No adverse feeling
is entertained for the native, but the line is drawn on
Asiatics.</p>

<p>The veld is so bare of any vegetation, save grass, in that part
of South Africa that there is not a native tree growing in a
radius of a hundred miles from Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>While traveling through farming districts in South Africa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
one misses the grain elevators seen at every station, and even
sidings, when passing through agricultural sections in the United
States and Canada.</p>

<p>Southward we headed for Capetown, passing through Modder
River and then Naauwpoort. Later we entered a stretch
of country known as the Karoo. Rain does not fall in
this district for a period of nine or ten months. For hundreds
of miles there is not a blade of grass to be seen, yet
goats, sheep, and ostriches abound, and grain is a product of
that strange stretch of land. Cradock, the metropolis of the
Karoo, is an oasis, because good shade trees are numerous. A
small bush grows, called karoo, on which goats and sheep feed,
and do well, if they do not die from thirst. The climate of the
Karoo is very favorable to persons suffering from lung trouble.
One of the best churches of Dutch design in South Africa is
found in Cradock.</p>

<p>We had now reached the Cape of Good Hope Province.
Southeast of Cradock is Kaffraria, at one time a separate
colony. Natives are numerous through that section. One of
the tribes of Kaffraria is the Fingo, a good native for the mines.
Hence, mine labor agents are to be found at every turn seeking
help. It is in that district where the traders do so well in
furnishing "boys" to the mines. Natives owning land, and
wishing to sell it, are not allowed to sell to a white person,
but may sell the land to a native.</p>

<p>Unlike Zulus, the natives throughout Kaffraria live in colonies.
The huts are principally made of mud and roofed with
straw. Different tribes are known to strangers by the blankets
they wear. One tribe wears a brown blanket and goes bare-headed,
while another wears a dark-colored cotton blanket, with
black cloth over their heads. This mode of dress pertains to
the native women.</p>

<p>Order is maintained in these settlements by a native appointed
by the government. When violations of law occur, the police
authorities go direct to this native, as head of the settlement,
who is held strictly accountable for any infraction. Cornmeal,
or mealy meal, the staff of life to natives of South Africa, costs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
$7 a bag, and 200 pounds provide "scoff" for four natives for
a month.</p>

<p>Africa, as generally known, is the home of the ostrich. In
South Africa alone they exceed 700,000, and this southwest
corner comprises merely one-twenty-fourth of the area of the
"Dark Continent." The territory lying between Kaffraria
and Capetown, however, is the section in which the ostrich industry
has reached its highest state of development. The
feathers are picked at periods of 18 months, the average yield
being three pounds, although some ostriches grow six pounds
of feathers in a season. These are mostly disposed of by auction
at Oudtshoorn, the clearing house for this product of the sub-continent.
Buyers representing leading feather merchants of
the world attend these sales. The price of feathers varies a
great deal, a common quality bringing only $25, while a good
grade sells for $100 a pound. The annual exports from this
industry amount to $15,000,000. A pair of ostriches sell for
$500 to $800. Fifteen eggs is the average composing a sitting,
and six weeks' hatching is required to bring forth the young.
Hatching devolves mainly on the male bird, he sitting at least
four weeks out of the six. The two weeks the female devotes
to sitting are objectionable ones to her, being whipped to her
task by the male bird from time to time to take even this unequal
part in bringing their brood into existence. The law prohibits
both shipping from, or taking out of South Africa, eggs of
this, the premier bird.</p>

<p>"Will you have some shiverin' jimmy?" asked a compartment
companion as he began unwinding a cloth from a bundle.
"I'm from Grahamstown," he continued, "where there is
nothing but 'pubs' (saloons) and churches. Have some
shiverin' jimmy," he concluded. By that time the cloth was
off the "parcel." What he called "shiverin' jimmy" proved
to be animated headcheese.</p>

<p>The train crept slowly down a steep grade, as we had left the
high veld behind. Mount Matroosburg, a thin sheet of snow
on its summit, was on our right, and on reaching Hex River
Valley we were in the sea zone, and not far from Capetown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>The interest associated with Table Bay, by reason of its early
explorers, massacre of early settlers, and the fighting with the
Hottentots of those who finally got a footing, comes to mind
when in this section. It was about 1653 that Johan van Riebeek,
a Hollander, started a settlement. Several attempts to
establish a white colony had been made earlier, but attacks by
the natives drove those daring men back to their ships. Van
Riebeek, however, succeeded. Cape Colony remained Dutch
for some years, afterward coming under British control, reverted
to the Hollanders again, then to England once more, and
has remained an English possession ever since.</p>

<p>To find a city to compare with Capetown, from a point of
unusual attractiveness, would be difficult. In front, Table
Bay, a charming sheet of blue water, spreads out to a good width,
and beyond rises the Drakenstein and Hottentots Holland
ranges of mountains, their castle-like peaks lending solemn charm
when viewed from a distance; above the city rises Table Mountain,
the feature of Capetown, with its two flanking towers&mdash;Devil's
Peak (3,300 feet) and Lion's Head (2,100 feet)&mdash;forming
the semi-circular valley in which the city rests so picturesquely.
The commanding, frowning and scarred front of
this unique mountain proves an object of admiration. Table
Mountain is three miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide.
The top is as level as a table, and, like other mountains in
South Africa, is barren of timber. Rising to a height of nearly
4,000 feet, a view from its broad, flat top is of unusual interest.
Antonio de Saldanha, in 1503, is said to have been the first
white man to scale its sides.</p>

<p>The Town Hall, Parliament buildings, a splendid public
garden, good museum, art gallery, colleges and other commendable
public institutions are fully in keeping with the natural attractiveness
of the Cape Peninsular. Creditable business buildings
and good docks are also prominent.</p>

<p>Durban's wide-awake business men, together with Capetown's
high charges to shippers, have taken from Table Bay the maritime
prestige she once enjoyed. The majority of ships going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
India and Australia do not come into Table Bay for coal, but
keep steaming until they have reached Port Natal.</p>

<p>Smokestacks about the shore of the bay are not numerous
enough to class the place as a manufacturing center. One often
wonders what people do to earn a living in some of the cities
of South Africa, in view of blacks doing so much of the work.
Wages in Capetown, the lowest paid in South Africa, are not
enough for comfortable living. Clerks, bookkeepers and
clerical help generally are offered $7 to $10 a week. House
rent is very cheap, however.</p>

<p>The blacks and colored of the Cape Province participate in
the franchise, and a native of Tembuland was a member of the
provincial Parliament. Strict laws in the old Boer provinces
prohibit selling liquor to natives. While all natives here cannot
vote, all voters have a right to drink liquor. So, if a
native has money to buy whisky, he need merely say he is a
voter and the saloonkeeper will take his word for it. When a
black man can drink all the whisky he can pay for, and has
a vote, that means insults and danger to life for the white of
both sexes. This is the deplorable stage reached, to a noticeable
degree, in Capetown. The white population is decreasing
and blacks are becoming more insolent. The native of
Capetown is not like the Zulu, nor the Barotse. He is copper
colored, lower intellectually, of uninviting features and meanly
inclined. Instances are frequent when the black of Capetown
will not share the sidewalk&mdash;the white man must step off or
get into a fight with half a dozen of these drunken natives.</p>

<p>To be allowed to land in Capetown one must have a hundred
dollars. Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, foreigners&mdash;no
one can land if he has not that sum. The tariff charged on
foreign goods is from 50 to 125 per cent. The latter figure applies
to tobacco. On a pound of American tobacco, which sells
in the United States for 40 cents, there is a tax of $1.20.</p>

<p>Sixteen days is the shortest time in which mail can be transported
from Capetown to England. The distance separating
these two points is 6,000 miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>Groote Schuur, the home of the late Cecil Rhodes, of very
striking design and richly furnished, is located here in one of
the finest estates in the world. Having a splendidly wooded
park, with good paths built at convenient sections, it is shaded
by the towering clefts of Table Mountain. The entrances to
the Rhodes estate were never locked, and one had only to push
open a gate to come in touch with nature in a superior form.
Passing away in 1902, eight years before the consolidation, but
far-seeing enough to know what the future policy of the country
would be, Rhodes bequeathed Groote Schuur to the first Premier
of a United South Africa. Louis Botha, elected to that high
office, thereby came into possession of this attractive home.</p>

<p>"Your Hinterland Is There" is one of the inscriptions
carved on the granite base on which the bronze figure of Cecil
Rhodes rests in the Public Gardens of Capetown. The front
of the figure is facing north, and a hand is pointed in the
same direction&mdash;to Rhodesia. "So little done and so much
to do" were the plaintive words of a man who had added 750,000
square miles to his country's already large possessions.</p>

<p>The wine industry is prominent in this province. Some years
ago the grapevines were ravaged by a disease. Grape stocks
were imported from the United States, and the native vine engrafted
to the American plant, when the industry again thrived.</p>

<p>Snook, a fish three feet in length, numerous about the Cape
Peninsula, seemed the principal food of a great number of poor
colored people of Capetown.</p>

<p>In a place that has been an English possession so long one
would expect to find a general use of the English language, but,
on the contrary, natives and a majority of Europeans speak
Dutch.</p>

<p>Newspapers and printing in general are ahead of the town.
The wages, however, are low compared to other large places
in South Africa.</p>

<p>"Hi'm the merry widow!" he shouted. "Hi'm the merry
widow!" A Cockney Jew, with a grooved face, was among
the merchants who sold goods&mdash;underwear, shirts, socks, haircombs,
handkerchiefs, etc.&mdash;on what is known as the Parade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Ground on certain days of the week. He wore on his head a
woman's white straw hat with a soft, broad brim, which flopped
against the sides of his face while he vigorously cried his wares.
Around the crown of the hat was a garland of artificial flowers&mdash;daisies,
roses, forget-me-nots, etc. He stood on a box, and
told his auditors he was almost giving everything away. He
talked at the rate of a thousand words a minute, more or less,
working so hard that the perspiration on his face resembled a
large water-soaked sponge when pressed. While streamlets of
sweat ran down the flutes in his cheeks, he frequently interlarded
his cheap-bargain harangue with, "Hi'm the merry
widow!" "Hi'm the merry widow!"</p>

<p>Nearly 200,000 people live in and about Capetown, and the
mixture is the worst in South Africa. Malays came to the
Cape Peninsula years ago, and the mongrel off-shoots of these,
with Arabs and natives of St. Helena and other places, emphasize
the word "colored."</p>

<p>Being situated at almost the junction of two seas, the South
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the climate is the best in South
Africa. The weather is never very hot, and frost is unknown.</p>

<p>We shall travel northward over the Karoo again to Bloemfontein,
then easterly across the Orange Free State to Ladysmith,
board a train going south, and return to Durban.</p>

<p>As stated in the early part of this volume, I had $1,350 when
I left New York. On returning to Durban I had $637.
With that sum I was about to start for India. The second day
after reaching Durban, however, I obtained work on the leading
newspaper, which furnished me with employment for six
months. My wages averaged $40 a week. Modest comforts
were good enough for me, and, living expenses being reasonable,
I was enabled to put away a snug sum. Work was there for
me if I wished to "drop in" the next year, so I promised to be
on hand. This opened an opportunity to visit another continent&mdash;Australia&mdash;which
I had not taken into calculation
before leaving New York, as at that time I had not money
enough to do so. So, early in January, I was on my way to
the Antipodes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>On my return from Australia I took another trip to Johannesburg
and back. I went to work the first of August and
continued to the middle of December. Then I made a trip to
Zululand, and upon my return was again offered work. As
I had not enough money for the remainder of the journey, I
decided to stay. Taking another trip to East London, Kingwilliamstown,
up through Kaffraria, to Cradock, Bloemfontein,
Kimberley, Johannesburg, Pretoria, and back to Pietermaritzburg
and Durban, in the middle of March, 1912, I went to
work for the third time, and finally bid good-by to Durban in
July following.

<h2>LEG THREE
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>Thirteen first-class passengers&mdash;four women, three men
and six children&mdash;boarded a steamship at Durban for Australia.
The vessel was a cargo ship, but had accommodation
for a small number of passengers. She had started from a
Swedish port in the Baltic Sea with a full cargo of pine lumber.
The distance from the Baltic port to Durban is 8,000 miles,
and the ship's final destination was to be Brisbane, Queensland,
Australia, over 7,000 miles further east. Speaking about long
voyages, this one should satisfy the most ambitious.</p>

<p>A Swedish woman, with two children, boarded the ship at
her home port, with Sydney as first landing. From Sydney
she intended to sail to the South Sea Islands, until she reached
Vavau, Tonga (Friendly Islands), still 2,000 miles further
east from Sydney, where she and the children were to join her
husband. The time required to travel from the Baltic seaport
to Vavau was over three months, counting stops.</p>

<p>From Durban to Melbourne, 6,000 miles, the fare was only
$100 first class. Food was good, the ship steady, and weather
fair. Our captain was a jovial soul, and the passengers proved
a congenial group. The vessel was well manned by a white
crew.</p>

<p>The second day out again found the albatross and Cape
pigeon as our companions. Later we sailed down to latitude
39, south of which sailors term the "roarin' forties," where the
weather became chilly. Two islands&mdash;St. Paul and Amsterdam&mdash;were
the only land seen during the voyage, and not a
single ship. One cultivates a genuine respect for seafaring men
when traveling on ships that bring one in intimate touch with
them. They are so thoroughly versed in the science of navigation
that they know to a foot's space almost what part of the
sea they are sailing over.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>One of our lady passengers, returning to Australia, her native
country, had her three children with her. Years before
she and her husband left for South Africa, where fortune smiled
on them; she was returning a wealthy woman. A New Zealander
and his wife, an Australian, also were returning from
South Africa. A baby had come to their home in Boerland
and they were returning to Kangarooland to show the hopeful
to their friends.</p>

<p>A feature of the sea at night in that stretch of the Indian
Ocean represents what might be termed a starry marine firmament.
The water contains phosphorous in sections, and, when
opposing forces clash, bright, blue-white lights come thickly to
view and twinkle and scintillate on crests of waves made by the
wash of a vessel. These sparkling beams have their season
during periods of contact, when, like embers, they gradually
flitter away as the waves assume their normal level. From
bow to stern the water line of a ship will be aglow with star-like
streaks, the wake of a vessel appearing as a "milky way,"
this marine illumination taking place where the sea is
"plowed" by merchantmen, as it were.</p>

<p>"Is that Rottnest Light ahead, captain?" asked the New
Zealander. "Aye," answered the skipper. "We'll anchor
outside the breakwater about 3 o'clock in the morning." We
had been sixteen days out from Durban, and every one had a
good voyage. In the forenoon, after the port doctor had completed
his examination of the passengers and crew, we passed
through the channel and into the harbor, and soon were alongside
a dock at Fremantle, West Australia. We had reached
Leg Three.</p>

<p>"What Ho!" is the national salute of Australia when countrymen
meet, and if the reader will allow me to step slightly
in advance of my notes, I shall take the liberty to offer, "What
ho!" to "the Down-unders." The use of the term "Down-unders"
is explained by Australia being situated almost in a
direct line under that section of the globe constituting Europe.</p>

<p>"A White Australia" is the slogan of the people of the
Antipodes, and the first thing one notices on coming from any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of the black countries is the absence of black men about the
docks.</p>

<p>Twelve miles up the Swan River from Fremantle, Perth,
the capital and metropolis of the State of West Australia, is
located. It was in 1827 that Captain Stirling sailed to the
mouth of the Swan River, where Fremantle is located. He
decided the location would make a good settlement site. Perth
later sprang into existence, however, and grew so fast that
Fremantle, with a population of 18,000 people, is but a port
for the State Capital.</p>

<p>Big things are met with in Australia, and the State of which
Perth is the official center is about four times larger than the
State of Texas.</p>

<p>One inwardly joins with the people of the Commonwealth
in their national slogan when the industrial activity is so strikingly
contrasted between "Darkest Africa" and "White Australia."
Australia is seen at her best when coming from any of
the black belts.</p>

<p>The European style of passenger coach is in use, and the
freight cars are also European, some of these not one-third as
large as the American box car. Small locomotives are also in
use. The country from Fremantle to Perth is sandy, the only
verdure growing being the eucalyptus, or gum tree, as it is
called. Homes seen along the railway track were of red
brick.</p>

<p>When Perth&mdash;with a population of 60,000&mdash;was reached&mdash;well,
it looked like one of the busy cities of the North.
Smokestacks, streets crowded with people, splendid buildings,
all work being done by Europeans, all vehicles drawn by good
horses&mdash;no oxen in sight; streets asphalted&mdash;in that far-off
land one will find as busy and as up-to-date a city as exists anywhere.
Credit for this substantial condition of things is more
strongly emphasized when it is remembered that West Australia
is very hot, more suited to black races than white.</p>

<p>Clean streets, with bright-colored red-brick residences, one
story in height, are prominent in this section of the country.
A large number of working people are their own landlords,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and those who do not own their own homes pay $3.50 weekly
rent. The weekly system of paying bills&mdash;house rent and
store bills&mdash;is the custom in Australia. As the government
owns the railroads, postoffice and other public utilities, the employes
in these departments, as those of municipal and private
employers, are also paid weekly. This has proved a good system.</p>

<p>The street car system is good, cars being of the double-deck
type. This was the first place the American system of street-car
transfers was noticed.</p>

<p>One finds here a splendid park square with plenty of free
seats and space, flowers and grass. In a larger park, a short
distance away, is a zoo. There is also a museum, art gallery,
a good library, hospitals and schools.</p>

<p>Many people were gathered in the larger park on a holiday,
and had brought lunch with them. The thermometer registered
107 in the shade. At one place in the park a big kettle,
three feet high, hung over a wood fire, was boiling. The holiday-makers
came to the kettle for hot water to make tea. It
looked out of place to see hot tea drunk in such weather, yet
tea is the non-alcoholic drink of that country, and is said to be
the best for that climate. The city employed the man who
boiled water for the tea.</p>

<p>Swan River is said to be the home of the black swan, the
graceful bird that makes ponds and lakes so attractive in many
parks in the world.</p>

<p>Good meals could be had for twenty-five cents. Grapes
were selling for four cents a pound, and peaches, melons, and
other fruit sold at a proportionately low price. Mutton sold
at four to six cents a pound; beef, from ten to twelve cents, and
pork at twelve cents.</p>

<p>Educating the young is a pronounced characteristic in West
Australia. The schools are maintained by the State, are free,
and attendance is compulsory from the age of six to fourteen
years. Twenty-one dollars is the sum the State fixes for the
schooling of a scholar. Scholarships of the value of $250 a
year are offered annually for competition among pupils between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the ages of 11 and 13 years. Other inducements are made to
bring out the best that is in the growing generation. In
sparsely settled farming districts, where ten or more children
are to be found, the State reaches out a beneficent hand to
qualify the child for the battle of life. In addition to appropriations
for their schooling, and where the children must ride
to school, 12 cents a day is paid to the person in whose vehicle
the children are carried to and from the schoolhouse. Where
a railroad runs through these sections, and the children ride
on trains to and from school, no fare is charged.</p>

<p>Very liberal inducements are held out to persons taking up
government land. Twenty years' time is allowed the settler
in which to pay for his farm, and the interest charged is four
to five per cent. Residential growth and improved conditions,
of course, result from the transaction.</p>

<p>To prevent destruction of crops by rabbits, which do a great
amount of damage to growing grain in some parts, the government
has gone to the expense of building rabbit-proof fences
about tracts of land it has for disposal. The quality of wheat,
oats and other cereals is of the best, meriting the awarding of
first prizes at world expositions where they have been on exhibition.
Sheep-raising is another great asset of Western Australia.</p>

<p>The rich gold fields of this State are located from 300 to
350 miles east of Perth, in the heart of a desert, of which a
large area of West Australia is composed. In 1884 gold was
discovered in this section of the Commonwealth, but a greater
rush to the mines occurred in 1890-92, when the Coolgardie
and Kalgoorlie finds became known. In this industry a hundred
thousand persons are engaged. Before a railway was
built over this barren stretch of country from the coast to the
mines, many an adventurous soul perished during his journey
in quest of the precious metal. No water is found in this district,
that needed in homes and for treatment of the ores being
"imported," pumped from a dam near Perth through pipes of
30 inch diameter for this great distance. Besides gold, copper,
tin and coal are mined. Black workers are excluded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>Wages paid are more equalized than in other countries.
Laborers receive a minimum of $2 a day, and mechanics from
$2.50 to $3 a day. Eight hours is a day's working time.</p>

<p>Newspapers are fully abreast of this hustling city. Printers
receive $21 to $25 a week, the hours of work on newspapers
seldom exceeding six. I had been offered work in Perth, but,
my destination being Melbourne, I continued eastward.</p>

<p>We had traveled 4,300 miles from Durban to Fremantle,
and 1,700 miles separate Perth from Melbourne. Twelve
hundred miles of that distance was to be across the Great Australian
Bight.</p>

<p>Fourteen hours' sail east from Fremantle, Cape Leeuwin
was reached, the most westerly point of land of the Australia
continent, and one of the most dangerous points for ships in
the world. The distance traversed to clear the Leeuwin is 25
miles.</p>

<p>Dutchmen were early explorers in Australia, and parts
touched bore the names of the head of the exploring parties, and
sometimes the captains of the ships. Some of the names were
Eendracht Land, Nuyts Land, De Witt Land; but of all the
places given names by the Dutch, Leeuwin Cape is the only
one well known. That part of Australia was early known as
New Holland. The Dutch set foot on West Australia 200
years before Fremantle became a settlement.</p>

<p>Across King George's Sound, on which Albany is located, we
sailed, when the Bight was entered. The Bight is famous for
its rough sea; accounts of the vengeance it has wreaked on
mariners, travelers and ships would fill many pages.</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll have a good voyage through the Bight,
captain?" asked a passenger. "The barometer indicates fair
weather," he replied. Continuing, he said: "The last time
we came through we had very 'dirty' weather. Slowly the
heavy sea was forcing us to shore. I saw we could not keep
our course with safety, so I pointed the nose of the ship to the
storm, but for 24 hours we gained only half a mile against the
force of the sea." "Did you fear for the ship?" "I wasn't
afraid," he answered, "so long as the engines stood the strain;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
but they were taxed for every ounce of power. Look at the
black mark on the chart. That is where a vessel went down,"
he added. When a sailor uses the term "dirty" weather, as
stormy and rough seas are called by seafaring men, a landlubber
will be at a loss to find a word in any dictionary to
describe what he thinks of such weather. We fortunately had
good weather through the Bight.</p>

<p>Cape Otway, about a hundred miles west of Melbourne,
marks the eastern end of the line that divides the Southern
Indian Ocean from the Southern Pacific Ocean, and the Cape
of Good Hope, in South Africa, marks the western end of the
line dividing the Southern Indian Ocean from the Southern
Atlantic Ocean. The distance separating these two points is
6,000 miles. The meeting of the currents of the two seas,
confined by the western coast of Australia, makes the water
very rough in the great bay, or Bight. From Cape Otway
eastward we were in the Southern Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven days after leaving Durban we sailed into Port
Phillip and up the Yarra River to Melbourne, where the
Swedish vessel was made fast to a wharf. "I trust we succeeded
in treating you right," said the captain on going down
the ship's ladder to the wharf. "Fair weather through life,"
were his parting words.</p>

<p>It is said an American laid out the city of Melbourne; if
that be so, this one service reflects much credit on the land of
his birth. In a world contest for the Commonwealth's capital
site design an American of Chicago was awarded first prize.
Australia aims at having the most attractive capital in the
world, to be located at Canberra, in the State of New South
Wales. American civil engineers also have taken a prominent
part in the construction of the large weirs or reservoirs that the
Commonwealth has erected for land irrigation purposes. Melbourne's
streets, 99 feet in width, run at right angles, are kept
clean and well paved. Built on each side of these grand
thoroughfares are splendid buildings, utilized for banking, trade
and general business purposes. What are called alleys in Melbourne
are wider than most of the business streets in Buenos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Aires. All goods brought to and from business houses go by
the back entrance. The sidewalks are free of all incumbrances,
such as iron doors and gratings. No abrupt steps from the
sidewalks are met with here, the walk, at an incline, sloping
gradually into the roadway.</p>

<p>One feature, though, mars that well-laid out, well-built and
well-managed city. It is a privately owned and privately managed
street railway system, which is of the antiquated cable
type. Some fifteen years ago a franchise was granted by the
city to a company to install street railways, of cable type, for
a term of 20 years. The fare is six cents, and the light in
the cars is from murky, coal oil lamps. The street railway
company is getting all it can out of the system, for it is
well aware that at the expiration of the franchise the city will
not renew the agreement, but will at once tear up the present
line and construct a modern one, more in keeping with Melbourne.</p>

<p>Melbourne is the capital of the State of Victoria and temporary
capital also of the Commonwealth. Victoria is termed
"The Garden State," and the prosperity of the country is reflected
in every part of the city by the splendid homes of its
citizens. They are healthy looking, well fed and well dressed.
This State, being visited by a regular rainfall, suffers less from
drought than West Australia, South Australia or New South
Wales.</p>

<p>The arrangement and scope of parks is admirable, and seats
are free. Streets, boulevards and roads here could not be bettered.
Within the city limits are over 5,000 acres of parks
and public gardens. An imposing Parliament House, a splendid
museum, art gallery and a zoo are other notable features.</p>

<p>Americans are not the only people who speak with a
"twang," for one meets persons in the capital city whose
"twang" would make a down-east Yankee green with envy.
Still all have the British accent. By nature, the Australian is
unreserved, and seems more American than British.</p>

<p>Melbourne is termed the "American City," and in the nature
of wearing apparel there is no difference in the cut of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
clothes. In South Africa, among the English-speaking people,
the brand of England is stamped on most customs, but in Australia
there is a difference.</p>

<p>Splendid college buildings, with nice grounds; training
schools, technical schools&mdash;at every turn the air is punctured
with turrets and spires on buildings in which the citizens of
Victoria are taught the sciences that enable them to take a
leading part in the advancement of the world.</p>

<p>The weather being so moderate in Australia, parks so attractive,
and bathing beaches so convenient to the coast cities, indoor
life loses its charm. In Melbourne the weather seldom
gets cold enough to freeze, and, if so, it would occur not more
than one or two nights during the winter season. The mean
temperature of that section of Australia is 55 degrees.</p>

<p>Athletic sports are very popular, as the weather permits of
such recreation the year round. Horse racing, as an amusement,
has a strong hold on Australians, and the same horde of
nondescripts and non-producers found in other countries, who
live by their wits on "the sport of kings," thrive and flourish
here on the money of those who earn an honest living.</p>

<p>"Mate" is the way Australians address each other, and for
an off-hand salute, sounds better than "Bill" or "Stranger."
"Right, ho," with scarcely a sound of the "h," is used entirely
in place of our "All right." A man with a small business&mdash;say,
a news store, green grocery, or printing office&mdash;is termed
a "cockatoo" news dealer, a "cockatoo" grocer and a "cockatoo"
printer. The term "cow" is used to express displeasure
or disgust with fowl, animals and even inanimate things. "On
the wallaby trail," or "on the wallaby," is applied to a fellow
"on his uppers." "No chop" means there is nothing in a
proposition made to the fellow who says "No chop." "He
'bally' well knew he was wrong" is an instance of how the
word "bally" is used here, as in England. "Tucker," in
Australia, is the term used when speaking of food, in the same
sense as "grub" in America.</p>

<p>The educational system of Victoria is of the same high character
as that of West Australia. The sum required to educate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
a scholar a year is $19, $2 less in Victoria than in West Australia.
It is the boast of State and government officials that
a child whose parents live in isolated parts receives as good
teaching as children in city schools. With such a splendid
school system, it is needless to touch on the advanced intellectual
position of Australians.</p>

<p>Government pensions for both husband and wife are paid
when they have reached the age of 60 years, and when their income
does not exceed $250 a year. The pension paid is $2.40
a week each, $4.80 for the old couple. Citizens who are incapacitated,
and have not reached the age of 60 years, are also
paid the $2.40 a week. Young persons deformed or mentally
incompetent also receive the pension, or, rather, their guardians
do. In cases where a man dies and leaves a widow and children
without means of support the government looks after them.
Any representative citizen living in the community in which
the fatherless family resides will accompany a family to court.
He tells the judge the circumstances attending the bereavement
of the family, and declares the widow is unable to support herself
and children. The mother then surrenders her children,
and they become wards of the State. When that phase of law
has been gone through, the judge next appoints the mother
guardian of the children. Each child thereafter receives $1.20
a week from the State. The children must attend school,
though, from the age of 6 to 14 years. This is the minimum
sum given by the State, but there also are municipal and other
funds to help needy citizens. Should a boy of such a family
become apprenticed to a trade after leaving school, the employer
pays the wages of the boy not to the mother, but to
a State official, in charge of that department. The boy's earnings
are put in a savings bank until he has reached his majority.
Reports are made as to his habits from time to time, and, should
he be of an industrious nature, the money that he has earned
while an apprentice is returned to him when he has become a
journeyman. How many poor, fatherless boys in other countries
have several hundred dollars handed them at 21 years of
age?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>No State or municipal poorhouses are found in Australia.
Homes, however, are provided for infirm persons, but these are
maintained by religious and charities bodies. The State, of
course, would lend a helping hand were these organizations
crippled for funds to carry on their laudable work.</p>

<p>To help settlers cultivate government land, from $250 to
$10,000 is advanced to an immigrant who means well. Certain
conditions in the nature of improvements and residence must
be complied with. The time given the settler in which to pay
back money advanced is 20 to 33 years. The interest charged
is four to five per cent. If drought or other agencies renders
the settler's crop a failure and he has no money to meet his payments,
the government does not swoop down and take his farm,
but advances more if circumstances threaten to drive him from
the land. He will be looked after until he has good crops.
The government has yet to lose a copper from advancing money
to settlers. Agricultural Department officials visit farmers to
teach them how to get best results from the soil. The land
does not become freehold property, however, but is leased for a
long term.</p>

<p>Two persons out of every five of the citizens of Victoria have
savings bank accounts. The average wealth in this State per
head of population is $1,253. An income tax is collected on
all salaries of $1,500 and over. The tax becomes greater in
proportion to the larger salaries or incomes received.</p>

<p>Previous to 1901 each State was a separate division, fixing
its own customs dues, legislating only for itself, and at each
State boundary line were custom houses and State officers. The
federation of States into the Commonwealth took effect January
1, 1901.</p>

<p>There is an average of three beeves to each person, and 20
sheep to each inhabitant. Mutton, beef, cheese, wine, fruit,
grain, flour, wool, hides, tin, silver, copper and iron ores are
exported from that far-off country to centers north of the
equator.</p>

<p>Melba, the opera singer, is from this State. In Paul Kruger,
South Africa produced probably the greatest man born south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the equator, and the fair State of Victoria has reason to be
proud of the diva, the most widely known woman born south
of the equatorial line. These two seem to be the total of the
Southland's contribution in recent times to the world's great
personages.</p>

<p>Some Chinamen live in Melbourne, but a majority of them
came to Australia years ago. These are mostly engaged in
furniture manufacturing, and Mongols practically control the
industry. The slogan, "A White Australia," is as pronounced
in Victoria as in other States. To gain entrance to Australia
an Asiatic must pay an immigration tax of $500.</p>

<p>Good newspapers are published in that city, but none issues
Sunday editions. Printers on these earn from $25 to $30 a
week. Other mechanics receive $18 to $21 a week.</p>

<p>Meat sells from 6 to 12 cents a pound; eggs from 20 to 36
cents a dozen. House rent, which is paid by the week, runs
from $3.50 to $4.50.</p>

<p>Class distinction is usually foreign to any new country, but
the lines are tightly drawn between labor and capital in Australia.
Skilled mechanics and laborers generally stand together
in political matters on election day, and the employer, capitalist
and that class of citizen oppose the labor party.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>Traveling from Melbourne to Adelaide, 483 miles, gave
opportunity to study Australian railways. The railroads are
State or government owned, and the fare is two to three cents
a mile. The coaches are of European type, the schedule 30
miles an hour. Compartments are generally fitted for eight
persons. One difference was observed in these coaches from
the South African&mdash;no free sleeping accommodation was provided.
Sleeping cars are run on Australian lines, however, but
a berth costs $2.40 a night. The system of heating the compartments
in chilly weather is by iron pipes, like those used in
the South African trains&mdash;foot warmers. But there is one
commendable feature about the Australian railway system,
namely, no steps to the cars, the platforms of all stations being
built on a level with the platform of the passenger coach.</p>

<p>"Mate, you may share part of my rug," spoke the man sitting
opposite in the compartment. "There'll be no chance to get
our feet on the foot-warmer, and the atmosphere will grow
chilly before morning. It is large enough for us both," he
kindly added. As in South Africa, almost every one in Australia
carries a rug, or blanket, as we call them. His kindness
was much appreciated, for, as it turned out, the foot-warmer
did not move in our direction for the night. This is another
instance of how obliging I found Australians.</p>

<p>A city looking more like a large park than a business center
is how Adelaide appeared. When laid out, in 1837, it comprised
a tract of land a mile square, and around this area is a
park strip of land half a mile wide. The mile square area was
originally the business and home section of Adelaide, but residential
requirements have far outgrown the original space.
Over two thousand acres of land in and about the city are set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
apart for public and botanical gardens, park squares and for
sports grounds. The city is located in a fertile plain, encircled
by a range of green hills on two sides, and has as a foreground
the blue water of St. Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<p>A pathetic incident accompanied the laying-out of this beautiful
city. After the surveyor, Colonel William Light, had
selected the site and surveyed the streets his plan was ridiculed
by his fellow colonists. Being of a sensitive nature, their criticisms
and jibes so worried him that he found relief from taunts
in an early grave. In Victoria Square stands a splendid bronze
monument to the designer of Adelaide, with this brief inscription
chiseled out of the granite base: "Light."</p>

<p>Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, has a population of
200,000. Its wide streets and great park space make the area
as large as that usually required for a city of half a million.</p>

<p>An agricultural college, mining college, and other means of
popular education insures a high percentage of intellectual attainment.
The same splendid public school system that has
been touched on as existing in West Australia and Victoria is
maintained by both the municipal and State educational departments
here. Money for educational purposes is voted to an
almost reckless degree by the States of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The homes of the people of Adelaide are fine. Where they
are not entirely built of stone, there is at least a stone front and
brick side walls. The houses are mostly one story, containing
from five to seven rooms, with a veranda on each and flowers
in every yard. Most of these homes are owned by the families
who occupy them, but some rent at from $3.50 to $4.50 weekly.
"Poor," "slum" and "wealthy" residential distinctions are
pleasantly absent in Australian cities.</p>

<p>The botanical garden, zoo, museum, State and municipal
buildings, business blocks, the lighting and street railway systems
are all very good. The ambition of the Australian seems
to aspire to the best, as little of a shoddy character is in evidence.
The statues about the cities also are as good as one will
see the world over. The stores and shops compare with any
for quality and attractiveness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinary meals could be had for 25 cents, and comfortable
accommodation, with good food, was obtainable in any of the
cities for $1.50 a day.</p>

<p>The bird life of the country adds to its attractiveness. The
emu, next in size to the ostrich, is on his native heath, and the
lyre bird is a native of Australia, too. In the "bush," as the
woods of Australia are termed, revel the cockatoo, macaw, parrots
of different species; the kookooburra, or laughing jackass,
and the smart magpie are quite numerous. Australians are
very proud of the native birds. Chasing the emu on horseback
is a sport indulged in in some sections.</p>

<p>The English sparrow was taken to Australia by settlers from
the British Isles, and he has proved a source of annoyance to
the people of that country, as well as that of others. Another
bird imported from England, the starling, a very dirty and
destructive one to berries, is also an eyesore to the people. This
bird is numerous in Adelaide. Rabbits were unknown in Australia
before settlers from the North made that country their
home. Being very destructive to crops, large sums of money
are expended to build rabbit-proof fences about tracts of farming
land owing to the millions of these creatures that infest the
country. The moderate climate admits of perpetual breeding.
Australians do not eat rabbit meat.</p>

<p>The rabbit trapper of Australia is an independent sort of
a citizen. His disposition is akin to that of the fellow who
will sit on a log all day to catch a six-inch fish, and considers
his time well spent when he walks into his home, carrying his
quarry by a spear of long grass pulled through the vent in the
gills. Ships loaded with frozen rabbits leave Australian ports
for England at frequent sailings.</p>

<p>The kangaroo is termed in Australia "the native," and is
harmless when met with under any circumstances. The smaller
specie is known as the wallaby. Kangaroo is the biggest game
on the Australian continent. Its tail is the only part used as
food, and then only for soup.</p>

<p>A story is told of an English woman who became engaged to
a native Australian. She started from England to meet her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
fiancé at Adelaide. She had told her friends she was to be
married to an Australian native. When she reached the end
of her long journey and came ashore friends in Australia who
met her, pointing to a kangaroo close by, remarked that the
animal was the native Australian. "What!" shouted the
bride-to-be. "Am I engaged to marry a kangaroo?"</p>

<p>The national flower is that of the wattle tree. This tree
grows large, its leaves are small and of a very dark green color,
and the limbs are dense. Blossoms come out very thick, and
leaves, limbs and body of the tree are hidden from view under
a profusion of rich, gold-colored flowers. Tracts of wattle-tree
groves extend for miles, and when all the trees are in bloom
it is a treat for the eyes seeking floral beauty.</p>

<p>Mutton and lamb are the meats chiefly eaten. One seldom
gets a good cup of coffee in British territory, for the reason that
the British are a tea-drinking race, and the same applies to
Australia. As evidence of the hospitality met with in homes
of British colonists, food dainties are always served with tea to
callers.</p>

<p>After having said good-by to Adelaide, we boarded a train
going to Melbourne. Upon reaching Ballarat, having heard of
the Eureka Stockade, behind which gold miners defied militia
in 1854, induced a longing to see this historical spot on the
Australian continent where men faced each other with firearms.
The skirmish between miners and troops came about through
the authorities charging miners exorbitant sums for gold mining
licenses. A stockade was thrown up&mdash;it is there to-day&mdash;and
from that shelter bullets whizzed at the troops, and soldiers'
bullets whizzed at the miners. The battle lasted ten minutes,
after two dozen miners had been killed. With this exception,
Australia is as barren of warfare lore as a large part of the
country is of vegetation. Gold mining is still in active operation,
and profitable. While gold is mined in all the States of
the Commonwealth, the output of the West Australia mines is
greater than the combined production of the other five.</p>

<p>When gold was discovered in Ballarat, in 1850, 65,000
people landed in Melbourne the next year, and in five years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
337,000 had found their way to the diggings, although in those
days vessels were small and slow, and the distance from Europe
to Melbourne is 13,000 miles.</p>

<p>Ballarat has a population of 50,000, is in the State of Victoria,
and 75 miles west of Melbourne. One of the principal streets
is 168 feet wide. How many cities are there in the United
States, the size of Ballarat, having an art gallery, a museum and
creditable botanical garden? Ballarat has these. A nice lake
also is within the city limits. The attractiveness of this place
is unusual for a gold mining center.</p>

<p>With an acquaintance, a football game between two crack
elevens was attended, and the price of admission to the grounds
was 12 cents.</p>

<p>Ballarat holds her own in the matter of buildings, good lighting
and street car systems.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>Passing from the ocean through The Heads to Sydney Harbor,
there unfolds to the eye perhaps the grandest foreground
of a city, landscape and soft-water scene to be found in any
part of the world. From the harbor&mdash;scalloped with pretty
bays&mdash;to the left rise, on a gentle slope, bright-colored brick
and red-sandstone homes with red-tiled roofs, the openings carpeted
with ever-green lawns, animated by flowering gardens,
a soft brush-grown space here and there, or a blushing cove,
walled by friendly rock&mdash;a willing partner to molding the
frame incasing this splendid picture. Traveling toward the
city, the vessel circuits evergreen islands, passing smart sailing
craft and swift-moving launches, when a point of land, part of
an attractive park, invitingly juts its grassy space into the noted
harbor. The Botanical Garden next comes to view, when the
Norfolk Island pine tree&mdash;none more shapely in the world&mdash;seems
to suggest to the visitor that there is something good even
beyond. To the right of the harbor&mdash;also fringed with cozy
bays and rippling coves&mdash;on another slope, there spreads out
a grand landscape that can come only from gum bush and
tropical foliage, the former in this instance. The harbor becomes
dotted with hurrying ferry boats, carrying people from
one side to the other. The city of Sydney then becomes outlined,
and, from the striking panorama of red-sandstone structures,
there is revealed a galaxy of towers, turrets, spires and
domes that unerringly suggest the highest industrial ideal of a
people living in a center of civilization and modern achievement.</p>

<span class="smcap">Australia.</span></p>
</div>

<p>As Capetown is the cradle of South Africa, so is Sydney the
cradle of Australia. Nine miles from Sydney, in Botany Bay,
James Cook, an Englishman, anchored his ship <i>Endeavor</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
That was in 1770, six years before the Declaration of Independence
was signed by the American colonists. For two hundred
years previous to Captain Cook's raising the British flag
on the shores of Botany Bay, Dutch, French, Portuguese and
Spanish navigators had gotten glimpses of that great continent,
but failed to implant the ensigns of their respective countries
on it as Cook did. It was anybody's country up to the year
1770. Section after section had been annexed by the English
from time to time, until all the continent and islands close
by had become British territory. Not a shot was fired to
acquire these different sections. Eight years after Captain
Cook reached Botany Bay, Arthur Phillips landed and formed
a convict settlement on the site from which Sydney had grown.</p>

<p>In 1788 there were but six head of cattle in Australia; to-day
there are over 15,000,000. In the same year there were
but 29 sheep; to-day nearly 100,000,000.</p>

<p>Heated arguments take place frequently anent the merits of
Sydney harbor and that of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, said to be
the two best harbors in the world. The distinction between
these two grand havens is similar to that existing between Victoria
and Niagara Falls. Where the land about Sydney harbor
gracefully slopes and admits of the striking panorama from
The Heads, or entrance to the Harbor, to Circular Quay, hills
shut from view the attractive city of Rio de Janeiro. The
Brazilian capital cannot be seen at a point where Sydney harbor's
beauty reaches its climax. On the other hand, Rio de
Janeiro's harbor is twice larger, dotted with over a hundred
tropical islands, and of good depth. The length of Sydney
harbor is eight miles, with comparatively few green islands, and
at places the water is none too deep for ships of great draught.
Also The Heads of Sydney harbor are squatty compared to the
high, bold stone pillars between which vessels sail through a
narrow but deep channel into Rio de Janeiro's haven. It
would seem that Sydney's harbor is the prettier, Rio de Janeiro's
the greater and better.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of a million busy and industrious people are
engaged in factory, mill, shop, office and store in modern Sydney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Every one of these will do any task with pleasure that tends to
enhance the commercial prestige and attractive appearance not
only of their city but of the Commonwealth. In no other
country will one find a more patriotic race of people; but,
though British subjects, their patriotism seemed to be for Australia.
They have a national flag, national emblems on their
money coins&mdash;in fact, Australia is deeply stamped on any and
every thing Australian.</p>

<p>Travelers are often disappointed when visiting points of interest
based on local reputation; but Sydney is the exception to
the rule. One can spend at least two weeks in the State capital,
going to different attractions from day to day, and will find
everything reputed to be of interest worth one's time going to
see. For this reason it has become known as the "holiday
city." Sydney is one of the most difficult cities in the world
to describe, because everything is so good. One would be justified
to begin and finish an account of Sydney with the word
"Splendid."</p>

<p>Not until I reached the capital of the State of New South
Wales did I find government or municipal ownership of public
utilities meant anything in the way of cheaper or better service.
The street-car service of Sydney is, I believe, the cheapest in
the world. The charge is two cents for each "stage," but the
"stages" in Sydney are far apart. The clumsy, slow, double-decked
car is not to be seen.</p>

<p>An express train leaves Sydney for Melbourne at 8 o'clock
every evening, and had one decided to start that journey on a
Sunday and depended on street car travel to the railway station,
he would surely miss his train. The cars come to a standstill
from 7 to 8 o'clock, while church services are being held.</p>

<p>A loaf of bread in Sydney must be a loaf of bread. The
legal weight is two pounds, and employes of the city bureau
who look after the staff of life keep a close watch on bakers
to see that customers are not cheated. An inspector is apt to
halt a driver of a baker's wagon at any point, jump into the
vehicle, pick up a loaf of bread, take from his pocket a collapsible
scale, put the loaf in the tray and particularly note its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
weight. If the bread should be an ounce under weight the
baker will be fined $5, and should the loaf be two ounces short
of weight he would be fined $10&mdash;$5 for every ounce under
two pounds. The quality of the bread, by the way, is, like
everything that goes to make up Sydney, excellent.</p>

<p>Vulgarity or profanity is not heard about the streets. Any
unsavory remark that reaches the ears of a policeman will cost
the careless one at least $2.50.</p>

<p>Stopping at a small and tidy hotel, located three squares from
the postoffice, the rate was but $1.50 a day. Good meals were
served at restaurants about the city at 25 cents. Serviette is the
word always used in British territory for table napkin.</p>

<p>House rent for working classes ranged in price from $15 to
$20 a month, payable weekly. Meat sold at 6 to 12 cents a
pound. Clothes are cheaper in Australia than in South Africa,
because Australia uses its own wool.</p>

<p>"When you will have brains enough to owe your butcher
$15, you'll get a better grade of meat." Two women were
seated on a bench in a park, talking about dresses, hats, engagements,
marriages and babies, when they touched on household
matters. One told the other her troubles with her butcher&mdash;could
not understand why she got inferior meat. Her companion
asked if she paid cash for her goods, and the complaining
one answered, "Yes." It was then that the suggestion contained
in the first sentence was made.</p>

<p>Concerning freedom of speech and liberty in a general sense,
one sees no difference from what he has been used to in his
own country while traveling about, but does admire the quality
of law that is dispensed and maintained in British territory.</p>

<p>While looking about the exhibits at a State agricultural fair
one can reach a fair conclusion as to the nature of a country
by the products shown, more particularly if one has been raised
on a farm. At a fair visited there were cattle with backs almost
as broad as a full-sized bed. The weight of some of these
animals was 2,500 pounds down to 2,000. It seemed as if an
exhibitor would be laughed at were he to enter a steer that
weighed under a ton. Horses on exhibit were of the same high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
class. The reputation of the Australian horse extends beyond
local bounds, and he is known as the Australian "whaler."
Sheep, chickens, pigs&mdash;from the top of the list to the last only
the best of each kind were exhibited. Australian cattle and
horses are aristocrats compared to South African breeds.</p>

<p>Education for children living in the "back blocks," as distant
parts of Australia are termed, is hauled on wagons. A government
teacher travels about in a wagon covered with a tent
and stops at the home of every settler who has children. The
tent is lifted from the wagon to the ground, and school exercises
are gone through. Would not the trouble and expense
that the Commonwealth of Australia goes to for fitting its people
to meet the struggles of life "warm the cockles of your
heart" to such a government! This is called the "traveling
school," and it would be a waste of time to dwell in detail on
universities, colleges, technical and the lower-grade schools of
the educational department of New South Wales.</p>

<p>The conditions of giving land to settlers by the State of New
South Wales are liberal. If one is a white man, is willing to
work, and wants a farm, he will get the land, and money to
make a start with, too.</p>

<p>The English system of money is in use. That system is not
on a decimal basis, which deficiency seems out of place in an
advanced country like that of the Commonwealth. For this
reason efforts are being put forth to change the system to a
decimal basis. The kangaroo and emu are stamped on the face
of some of the money coins in use, but these will not be accepted
as legal tender in other British countries.</p>

<p>"Smoke, ho," is the term one might hear were he to pass a
gang of men working on a railroad or at any work where a
group of men are employed. The weather gets very hot in
summer, and rests are taken at intervals. When the foreman
of the gang says "Smoke, ho," that means a breathing spell, or
quitting time.</p>

<p>The State of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the
capital, is the richest in the Commonwealth. The sheep industry
is the greatest. Smokestacks from factory and mill are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
thickly dotted not only about the city but far into the suburbs.
Great quantities of butter, beef, mutton and wool, wheat and
flour are exported from that State, besides ores and coal. The
exports from Australia now are very large, but what will they
be when the country becomes even one quarter settled?</p>

<p>Wages have increased from time to time in Sydney, until
now bricklayers receive $5 a day. That figure is good wages
in Australia, for the climate permits of outside work the year
round. The city is growing all the time, the demand for
mechanics naturally increasing. Few mechanics receive less
than $3. The lowest wages laborers receive are $2, but that
figure is often exceeded. Printers on newspapers earn $27 to
$30 a week, the working time not exceeding 36 hours. Good
board can be had at $4 to $6 a week. No one works Saturday
afternoons in the British colonies visited.</p>

<p>Excellent newspapers are published in Sydney&mdash;fully in
keeping with the city. On looking over their pages, one must
give much credit to the publishers for the cable dispatches
printed, as the news rate must be high when sent from centers
6,000 to 13,000 miles away.</p>

<p>A thousand acres of splendid park area are located in and
close to Sydney, divided into 37 parks. Within a radius of 25
miles are 70,000 acres of park land. Besides, there are half
a dozen good bathing beaches within easy reach.</p>

<p>Over a hundred miles from Sydney, in the Blue Mountain
range, is located a tract of stalactite and stalagmite caves.
These are the property of the government, and known as Jenolan
Caves. The caves cover a large area of land, and exploration
is going on all the time. Over a dozen of these are now
open to visitors, and the trip is well worth while taking. But
while Jenolan Caves are much greater than those of Luray
Caverns, Virginia, one will find in Luray better formations and
a prettier grade of that mineral than can be seen in Jenolan.
It is another case of Victoria Falls and Niagara. Jenolan
Caves are much the greater, but Luray Caverns are the prettier.
In caves of this character columns of stalactite and stalagmite a
foot in diameter may be seen, and when it is remembered that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
in one instance at Jenolan, a stem of stalactite has grown but
one-thirty-second part of an inch in 30 years, what a tremendous
age the larger columns must have attained! The atmosphere
in this section of the Blue Mountains is of a deep blue color.
Mount Kosciusko is the highest peak of Australia, rising 7,308
feet.</p>

<p>In that section of country kangaroo may be seen hopping
about the hills, feeding on grass and sprouts, or standing up
on their hind legs to watch if any one is coming their way.
Timidity starts them, at the slightest alarm, to holes in the
mountain, and where rocks are located at the place of concealment
these are as polished granite from their heavy tails passing
over them on coming out and going in.</p>

<p>The difference in railroad gauges is proving a source of much
inconvenience to transportation. In New South Wales the
gauge is standard, 4 feet 8½ inches, and in Queensland the railroad
is narrow-gauge, 3 feet 6 inches. So, going from Sydney
to Brisbane, passengers, cars and freight must be changed; also
in going from Sydney to Melbourne, when the Victoria border
has been reached, a complete change has to be made, as the Victoria
gauge is broad, 5 feet 3 inches. The width of South
Australia railroads is 5 feet 3 inches and also 4 feet 8½ inches,
but those of West Australia are again narrow-gauge.</p>

<p>One not familiar with the population of American cities
would come to the conclusion that San Francisco, Cal., was
the greatest in the United States, judged from the number of
times it is mentioned by Australians. As a matter of fact, both
Melbourne and Sydney have a greater population than the
Californian metropolis. Seldom are New York, Philadelphia
and Chicago mentioned. This is accounted for by San Francisco
being nearer to Australia than any other American city.</p>

<p>"Two years before the fleet came," and "About a year after
the fleet was here," are instances of how recent great events
are referred to. Evidently the visit of the American battleships
to Australia, when the fleet made its trip around the
world, proved an epoch in this country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving the "mainland," I want to acknowledge my
gratitude to Australians for the many courtesies extended and
kindnesses bestowed. I had been offered work in most of the
places visited.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>From Melbourne we sailed across Bass Straits up the Tamar
River to Launceston, Tasmania, located at the northern part of
the island. Abel J. Tasman, a Dutch navigator, discovered
what is now Tasmania, in 1642, after whom the island is named.
Van Diemen's Land, however, was the name given to Tasmania
by its discoverer, but was changed later. The Dutch seemed
to have been good navigators in early years in the Pacific and
Indian oceans, but they proved poor land-grabbers. With
Tasmania as a key to the mainland, it would seem the spirit
of daring did not extend further than the decks of ships, for
Tasman finally left Tasmania, and later on it fell into the
hands of British navigators.</p>

<p>Tasmania is the smallest of the six States of which the Commonwealth
is composed. It has its upper and lower legislative
bodies, a governor from England&mdash;in all respects a self-constituted
State. The length of the island from north to south
is 150 miles.</p>

<p>Tasmania is known as "the sanatorium" of Australia on account
of its good climate. At Launceston this was plainly
borne out by the rosy cheeks of the people. The city itself, of
25,000 population, is attractive from its parks, its iron-latticed
porches and verandas, a splendid stretch of natural scenery
known as the Gorge, and the unassuming nature, plain but
tidy appearance, and contentment of the people. Few smokestacks
were in sight, and as a business center it does not hold
kinship to the bustling cities of the mainland.</p>

<p>"This is the way it is all the time!" said a second-hand
clothing dealer who had invited me to call at his store, he having
gone from America to the Southland to make his fortune.
The store was as empty of customers as a church is of worshipers
at midnight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>The commendable custom of Sunday evening concerts in the
colonies was in vogue in Launceston, only the one attended
here was held in a beautiful park instead of in a town hall. As
in other places, the concert did not begin until after church
services. In the same park is a small zoo, very good for the
size of this city.</p>

<p>The wages of workers are low, mechanics receiving from $2
to $2.50 a day. Calling on one of the daily newspapers to see
how things looked, when it became known that I was from the
United States most of the composing room force stopped work,
gathered about me, questions coming eagerly concerning conditions
in America from every angle. I was to leave the city
a few hours later, when two of the force left their work and
saw me on the train.</p>

<p>Hobart, 135 miles south of Launceston, was the next stop.
This is the capital of Tasmania, and has double the population
of Launceston. Hobart is situated at the delta of the Derwent
River, and has a splendid harbor, with Mount Wellington behind
the city, water in front, and a large domain or park at
one side. While showing little life commercially, there is a
charm about the Tasmania capital that sticks to one.</p>

<p>Three women to one man is Hobart's unequal population.
The wages are so small that any young fellow with an ounce
of pluck will cross Bass Straits to the mainland cities, where his
labor sells for more than a bare living wage, with opportunities
for amounting to something later that Tasmania does not offer.
A preserve or jam factory in Hobart furnishes girls and women
with employment.</p>

<p>Food and house rent are cheap, and for these reasons, together
with the splendid climate all the year round, a considerable
number of ex-British army officers, who have a pension, go
there to spend their last days.</p>

<p>No stale fish is eaten in Hobart. At the wharfs many fish
dealers are found, and their stock is kept in barges or scows
containing enough water for the fish to swim in. A customer
points out the fish he wants to buy, when it is speared and
handed to the purchaser alive. One fish found in that locality&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
"trumpeter"&mdash;is as sweet as American shad, and it has
fewer bones. Oysters do well also in Hobart waters, as that
city is nearly as far south of the equator as New York is north
of that line. Fish caught in a warm climate have not the same
flavor as fish that inhabit the waters of a colder one. An angler
is at home when lolling about the brooks and rivers that abound
a short distance from the city.</p>

<p>A dollar a day was all I paid for accommodation at a tidy
hotel. That sum included three meals and a room.</p>

<p>One will find here a good museum, creditable art gallery and
splendid park system, also a good street car system, electric
lights, gas and other utilities.</p>

<p>"Appleland" would be a suitable name for Tasmania, as
upward of 3,000,000 bushels of apples are shipped from that
island each year, and the shipments are increasing. The Huon
district, some 20 miles from Hobart, is the great apple growing
section of southern Tasmania. Apple trees grow in these parts
where nothing else would thrive, and large tracts of orchards
are seen on the sides of rocky hills. Trees are not allowed to
grow over six feet high, which adds much to the convenience
and cheapness of picking. They are trimmed each season, and
the stumps are eight inches in diameter in some instances, but
only the stump, which will not rise over six inches above the
ground, is left. The sprouts grow from the stump, and these
do not, as stated, exceed six feet tall. These apples do not hang
only from the ends of the limbs, as they do from most apple
trees in America. Blossoms bloom from the body of the limb,
and the limb and trunks of the sprouts are entirely covered with
apples. Apples grow from the limbs as freckles on an arm.
Ten acres of apple land in southern Tasmania bring in a nice
yearly income. The trees grow bushy, and as many as 20
bushels are often picked from one. Most of the apples shipped
from Hobart go to England, the time of shipment being from
February to June.</p>

<p>Fifty miles from Hobart stands the walls of the old Port
Arthur Prison, as well as the walls of the church, cracked and
ready to fall, covered with ivy vines, where the prison officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
worshiped; the nice avenues of trees where the freemen enjoyed
the shade on a hot day are very pretty, and the cozy bay, with
Point Peur jutting into still and attractive waters, suggest
nothing, so far as nature is concerned, as to the place having
been one of the most inaccessible, impenetrable prisons of the
world. What was known as the hospital building is in good
condition, and serves the small community of Carnarvon as a
town hall and public school.</p>

<p>Port Arthur has been changed in name&mdash;to Carnarvon&mdash;as
most of the places that have had anything to do with the
early prison days of Van Diemen's Land. The prison was located
on a strip of land, 12 miles in length, called Tasman
Peninsula. Water naturally borders both sides of the peninsula,
and the narrow neck of land at the head&mdash;Eagle Hawk Neck&mdash;of
the peninsula is less than a quarter of a mile wide.</p>

<p>Just across the small bay from Port Arthur is Point Puer,
on which for years there had been a boys' prison. Both men
and boys sent to these prisons, located 13,000 miles from England,
had committed alleged offenses in Great Britain. In addition
to these two male prisons there was also one for women,
but the latter was not located at Port Arthur. The ages of
boys sent to the Point Puer ranged from 12 to 15 years. A
number committed suicide, induced by homesickness and other
causes. This inhuman state of affairs being brought to the
late Queen Victoria's attention, she ordered the boys' prison
razed to the ground.</p>

<p>The narrow neck of land referred to separates Norfolk Bay
from the Pacific Ocean. To-day there are, or were recently,
a row of posts standing across Eagle Hawk Neck&mdash;from Norfolk
Bay to the ocean. To these posts dogs had been chained,
the chains just long enough to allow a dog fastened to one post
to meet the other. Some of these posts were driven in the bottom
of Norfolk Bay, and on them was built a rest for the dogs
to jump on when the tide was in. On each side of the narrow
strip of land soldiers were stationed, the string of dogs between.
Were a prisoner, in trying to escape the hardships of
Port Arthur, to get beyond the sentries, and attempt to get by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the dogs, an uproar would be made by the canines, and the
sentries on the other side would be on the alert if a prisoner
chanced to get by the vicious dogs; so that any effort to escape
by that route would be futile.</p>

<p>Norfolk Bay at that point is also narrow&mdash;not over a quarter
of a mile wide&mdash;several prisoners making their escape by
swimming across. To forestall further escapes by that means,
sharks, which had been imported, were placed in the bay and
fed. So, between the soldiers and the dogs on guard at Eagle
Hawk Neck and Norfolk Bay full of sharks, once brought to
Tasman Peninsula escape was impossible.</p>

<p>Masks were worn by prisoners when they attended church
services, so that no recognition could take place. In addition
to that precaution, the seats in the church had a board at the
back as high as a man's head, and the prisoner was closed in by
boards on each side. The preacher was the only man that could
be seen when sitting in the box seat. From 1842-46 19,000
convicts were sent to Tasmania. Sometimes many died during
the voyage. The only humane feature connected with the
convict traffic was that the ship doctor received $2.40 for every
prisoner who landed in Tasmania. Naturally, the doctor
would do his best to collect the fee. The last shipment of convicts
took place in 1877. It is said some prisoners sent to Tasmania
had committed minor offenses, such as shooting a rabbit
on another's property, stealing chickens, inability to pay debts,
and similar charges.</p>

<p>Eucalyptus trees are said to grow to a height of 350 feet in
certain parts of Tasmania, and also in some other States.</p>

<p>Reading accounts of the products of the Commonwealth, its
exports of wool, meat and ores, and being unfamiliar with the
obverse side of the picture&mdash;droughts, deserts and the rabbit
pest&mdash;one would little expect to hear the question asked,
"Will the 5,000,000 industrious populace of Australia, a name
that fascinates as does California, and having an area one-quarter
that of the British Empire, ever increase to 25,000,000?"</p>

<p>Only a fringe of this continent is habitable, behind these fertile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
tracts being expansive wastes, on portions of which rain does
not fall, at times, for several years. No such river as the
Nile or Mississippi flows through these salt deserts. Near the
coast, visited by moderate rainfalls, are sections in which
drought is ever feared, where wells have been bored to depths
of thousands of feet, only to find, when a water vein has been
pierced, that, in many instances, the flow proves to be salt
water, unfit for drink or irrigation purposes. The two chief
rivers of Australia&mdash;the Darling and the Murray&mdash;are small
compared to waterways that course other countries. In dry
seasons the water becomes low, and in drought periods the bottoms
of these rivers offer little more moisture than is found on
the plains.</p>

<p>Not more than one per cent. of the land of this great continent
is under cultivation. In order to insure the harvesting
of crops in favorable seasons, millions and millions of dollars
have been expended by the government in building rabbit-proof
fences; the quantity used would encircle the globe nearly half a
dozen times. Added to this outlay, large sums have been expended
in boring wells, building reservoirs and establishing
water stations on cattle and sheep ranges. Buying land from
landowners controlling large tracts, obtained by devious means
in the early stages of the country's development, is still another
heavy national expense. This land, when allotted to small farm
settlers, is leased. Leasing the land, instead of granting the
freehold, does not augur for a rapid increase in the rural population.</p>

<p>Quality, not quantity, seems to be the aim of the Commonwealth
in regard to the immigrant entering its shores. "Assisted
passages" apply chiefly to domestic help and agricultural
workers of British birth or of British descent, and these must
be in good health and of sound body. A strong sentiment seems
to be prevalent for immigration, but those engaged at the various
trades, and even the professions, do not encourage the
coming of additional artisans to the respective vocations or an
increase of names to the professional roster. Hence, the small
volume of immigration to the Antipodes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>With a desert comprising a major portion of the continent, a
temperature of 100 to 120 degrees prevailing over a large area,
with but few rivers, pure water lakes or refreshing streams,
and the bowels of the earth giving up brackish and salt water,
thereby dispelling hope of the sandy wastes being reclaimed and
the ravages of drought counteracted&mdash;meeting with failures in
battling to overcome these natural barriers to development, we
can picture running through the Australian's mind the paraphrased
biblical quotation: "Paul may plant, Apollo may
water, but God must give the increase."

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Our first stop in New Zealand was at Bluff, a small port
nearly a thousand miles eastward across the Tasman Sea from
Hobart. Though composed of only a few hundred people,
this place, nevertheless, commands the attention of a traveler,
as it is one of the most southerly outposts of civilization, there
being no white habitation between Bluff and the South Pole.
Tons of cheese and butter were here loaded into the ship,
brought by rail from Invercargill, eighteen miles inland, the
commercial center of a thrifty farming district.</p>

<p>Abel J. Tasman, in 1642, was the first white man to discover
New Zealand. He was frightened away by a warlike and fearless
race of natives, but mapped out the coast line roughly, and
named the country Staaten Island, which Dutch officials altered
later to New Zealand. Captain James Cook, in 1769, was the
first to land on New Zealand soil, which he did after much
dickering with the Maoris; it then became a British possession.</p>

<p>While traveling through Devereux Straits from Bluff to
Dunedin, one of the three islands comprising New Zealand&mdash;Stewart
Island&mdash;was to the south. It has an area of 665
square miles, a mild and pleasant climate, and was a favorite
assembling place for American whaling ships twenty-five to
thirty years ago. A Maori settlement, most of the natives
being fishermen and oysterers, form the chief inhabitants.
Oban, twenty miles from Bluff, is the principal town. The
straits between South and Stewart Islands was red with prawns,
and thousands of fowl were feeding off these crustaceans; the
birds make their home on the latter island. Later we reached
the Heads of Otaga harbor, passed Port Chalmers, and seven
miles further the vessel docked at Dunedin, a stronghold of
the Scotch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>In 1848, after a voyage of several months in sailing vessels,
two ship loads of Scotch Presbyterians from Scotland sailed up
Otaga harbor and disembarked at what is now known as Dunedin,
where they formed a settlement. Scotch energy was at
once put into action&mdash;some of the colonists building homes,
others turning over the soil of this virgin country, then seeding
the land, later harvesting their meager crops&mdash;all initial
undertakings requiring more patience and persistence than afterward,
when better supplied with tools and implements, and more
familiar with natural requirements. From this small beginning&mdash;
followed by periods of anxiety, disappointment and
hardship, as settlers, with more courage than money, in most
all new countries have endured in battling with the uncertain
phases which confronted them&mdash;the pluck of these hardy pioneers
is represented in Dunedin being the metropolis of southern
New Zealand.</p>

<p>Losing time hunting for level land or gently sloping hills on
which to establish a city was not the Scotch way of doing
things. The hills are so high, steep and rugged where the
citizens of this center live that electric power would fail to
draw street cars up some of the inclines; hence steps are cut
into the rocks, and walks, made of boards, lead up to many of
the homes. Like the rocky hills within the municipality, Dunedin
is solidly built. Dark graystone figures largely in building,
and streets are good and well looked after. An electric street
car system is another asset, and the railway station is one of the
best government buildings in New Zealand. Numerous church
steeples rising about the metropolis attest the well-known religious
tendency of this race; an art gallery, museum, libraries,
schools, colleges and other factors indicating intellectual advancement,
are found here&mdash;14,000 miles from Scotland and
the gateway to the Antarctic region&mdash;a credit to Scotland grit.
Among the manufactures are woolen goods and farm machinery.
Frozen meat exports from the Island Dominion, as this country
is often termed, are large. This great industry had its inception
here, the first cargo being shipped in a sailing vessel from
this port in 1881. Burns' clubs, bagpipe bands&mdash;which thrill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
a Scot wherever found&mdash;and Caledonian societies have flourished
here since its settlement. The bands keep things lively,
appearing frequently in complete regalia, the pipers holding their
own with any in Scotland.</p>

<p>Sixty thousand people live in Dunedin, these being mainly
Scotch. Some of the early colonists came from Dundee and
others from Edinburgh, Scotland. While settlers from the
former were bent on naming their new home Dundee, those
from the latter wanted the place called Edinburgh. A compromise
was finally reached by their taking the first syllable of
Dundee (Dun) and the first and second syllables of Edinburgh
(Edin), calling the place Dun-edin.</p>

<p>Ho! An American flag was flying from the mast of an old
three-masted schooner in Otaga harbor. Though I had traveled
nearly 22,000 miles since leaving New York and had been
at the main ports of three continents, this was the only occasion
the Stars and Stripes was observed flying from a vessel.</p>

<p>Little difference was observed here in the clothes worn or the
general customs in vogue in America; but British names for
certain business callings are the rule, such as ironmonger, fishmonger,
mercer, draper, etc.</p>

<p>Everybody cuts their own bread in Dunedin. Sometimes
resting on a wooden dish, and in other instances on an ordinary
piece of board, the loaf is placed on the table, with a big knife
alongside. Meat is served carved, however.</p>

<p>Splendid horses are noticeable&mdash;the big, heavy-bodied, hairy-legged
Clydesdale breed.</p>

<p>Street cars do not run earlier than 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoons,
when church services are over.</p>

<p>Liquor licenses are issued only to hotel-keepers; none to
places where travelers are not accommodated. Hotel expenses
were only $1.50 a day.</p>

<p>South Pole expeditions sailing from Europe generally call
and remain some time at Port Chalmers to refurnish their
stores before piercing the icy reaches of the Antarctic division of
the world, and this is the first port explorers reach upon emerging
from that but partially known region. Dual names to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
many seaports throughout the British Empire prove confusing
to the ordinary person. A news cablegram may tell of a South
Pole exploring vessel having reached "Port Chalmers, N. Z."
Seafaring men would know at once by the name the message
bore that the explorers were in Dunedin; but very few persons
in America or Europe would know that Port Chalmers and
Dunedin denote the same place. Durban, South Africa, is another
instance of a place known by two names. A seafaring
man would call Durban "Port Natal" instead of the name by
which it is better known; and cables also give it as Port Natal.
Instances could be cited of a captain saying he was sailing to a
certain "port" which a passenger never heard of, but who
would readily recognize the place if the name was mentioned as
it is designated in books.</p>

<p>The apteryx&mdash;or kiwi, as this bird is generally called&mdash;is
a native of New Zealand, and one of the strangest fowl in the
world. Man, beast, animal and fowl have been provided with
two arms and two legs, four legs, or two legs and two wings,
respectively. The kiwi, as large as a hen and brown of color,
however, has been furnished with two legs, but has no wings.
Its feet are similar to those of other fowl; it has a long bill, and
thin, scattering feathers grow straight from its head. The
sides of the kiwi appear as free of wings as those of a cat. The
habits of that strange bird are similar to the pheasants. Its
call note, "ki-i-wi!" uttered during the early hours of the night,
has great penetrating power, and ceases after midnight.</p>

<p>"Not far from here is a waterfall with a drop of 2,000 feet&mdash;the
highest in the world," remarked a patriotic New Zealander.
"Is it an uninterrupted waterfall?" was asked.
"No, there are several breaks," was the answer. When reminded
that Yosemite Falls, in California, has a sheer drop of
1,600 feet and a total descent of 2,400 feet, it occurred to him
he may have used the word "world" inadvisedly. Not far
from Dunedin is the natural scenic section of that country,
with a splendid chain of lakes, glaciers, high mountains and
attractive gorges. The highest mountain in Australia is 7,000
feet, and Mount Cook, not far from Dunedin, rises to 12,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
feet. Cold weather prevails in this section in winter, accompanied
by ice, snow and blizzards.</p>

<p>No snakes or poisonous insects are said to be found in that
country. One may lie down on the earth in any place and have
no fear of being bitten or stung by anything that lives under or
on the surface.</p>

<p>From Dunedin to Christchurch I had my first experience
riding on New Zealand trains, owned by the government.
Some of the passenger coaches are patterned after the American
cars. The track is more than a foot narrower&mdash;3 feet 6
inches&mdash;which does not allow room for two persons on a seat
on each side of the car aisles. One row of seats will seat two
persons, but those on the other side accommodate but one person.
Seats are upholstered, and the train schedule is 30 miles
an hour. This was a first-class car, and the fare three cents a
mile. Some of the second-class coaches are not as well equipped.
Boards, secured to the sides, with only a thin cushion over them,
run the length of the vehicle. It is merely a bench, no partition
separating passengers, the side of the coach serving as a back
rest. The corner seats are coveted ones, as a passenger can put
his back to the end and stretch his legs. It is the worst accommodation
I have seen in railroad coaches. The government
charges its patrons two cents a mile; no reduction in fare is
allowed for return tickets.</p>

<p>A hundred miles south of Christchurch the road passes
through a rich farming country known as Canterbury Plains.
Farm land in that district sells at $200 to $300 an acre. Great
quantities of frozen mutton, wool and grain are shipped from
Timaru, a seaport town in that section. As many as 6,000,000
carcasses of mutton and lamb are shipped from New Zealand
each year. There are over 25,000,000 head of sheep in
the Island Dominion.</p>

<p>One would never think it was possible to conduct a farm on
an eight-hour basis, yet those are the hours worked by farm
hands in New Zealand, with extra pay for overtime. Wages
are good, also, as they run from $30 to $40 a month with board.</p>

<p>One would feel safer with hobnails in the soles of his shoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
while walking about some of the residential sections of Dunedin,
so steep are the hills; but Christchurch is built on a level surface&mdash;on
Canterbury Plains. Dunedin, as stated, was settled
by the Scotch, but Christchurch was settled by the English in
1850, two years after the foundation of Dunedin was laid.</p>

<p>Instead of States, the Dominion of New Zealand is divided
into provinces, and Christchurch is the metropolis of the Canterbury
Provincial District. It has a population of 70,000
thrifty people, and the city is rich in beautiful flower gardens,
fruit trees, and grassy lawns, while the River Avon, its water of
a glassy clearness, and its grassy and tree-covered banks, uniting
in forming a picture, winds attractively through the city.</p>

<p>Here may be seen splendid churches, colleges and schools.
Seldom is a church the center or hub of a city, yet street cars
stop and start from the Cathedral of Christchurch, and it is the
point from which distances are measured. No skyscrapers, nor
such grand buildings as Melbourne and Sydney can boast of
are seen here, yet everything has a solid, attractive and complete
appearance.</p>

<p>The homes of the people attract attention by the large space
in front of them and at the sides. Each lot contains one-quarter
of an acre&mdash;66 feet in front and 136 feet in depth.
Houses are mostly one story, and flowers, shrubs and grass in
front and at the sides add much to their comfortable appearance.
Most of these are owned by their occupants, and where
rent is paid, which, as in Australia, is on a weekly basis, the
rate is from $3 to $5. Every home has its own reservoir or
water supply. Some thirty feet under the surface there is
said to be a lake, and each householder bores in his yard until
the water gushes up. The waste water running from these
thousands of wells serves as a flushing system. Christchurch
streets are of good width&mdash;66 feet.</p>

<p>One could not expect to visit a prettier place than Hagley
Park, through which the beautiful Avon River runs. Weeping
willow trees grow on the banks, and the ends of their
drooping limbs are constantly refreshed by the water in which
they rest. Besides the general attractiveness of the park, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
is a splendid museum containing much of interest, built within
the grounds.</p>

<p>"Wait Until Car Stops, Fine $25," is a caution to passengers
posted in street cars of that city. Were street car companies
in some American cities fined $25 every time a conductor
forgot to signal a stop at places where he was requested to do
so there would be more appointments kept, money saved passengers,
and less wrangling.</p>

<p>Every one is his own bread carver here, as in Dunedin. The
New Zealander, like his Australian brother, is a meat eater.
Beef sold at 10 to 12 cents, mutton at 6 to 8 cents, and pork
at 12 cents a pound.</p>

<p>Good newspapers are printed in this city. Wages are $15 to
$16 a week. Laborers receive $2 a day. An eight-hour day
is universal in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The system of measurement in both New Zealand and Australia
is that of the chain&mdash;66 feet. A chain wide, two chains,
two-and-a-half chains long, are the terms used.</p>

<p>Prohibition has a considerable hold on the people, as most of
the smaller cities are "dry."</p>

<p>Double fare may be charged by cab drivers on holidays only,
but in other countries cabbies collect excess fares any time patrons
will pay them.</p>

<p>Theaters, bioscopes, amusements and sports of all sorts are
found in the city, being freely patronized.</p>

<p>The kea bird of New Zealand is destructive to sheep, and
for that reason the government pays a bounty of $5 for every
dead kea. This bird is of the parrot species, dark green in
color, with a bill an inch and a half in length, curved like a
parrot's beak. It will alight on a sheep's back, and at once
attack the animal in the section of the kidneys with its sharp
bill, as the only part the kea cares for is the fat growing about
the kidneys. The animal naturally bleeds to death in a short
time, when the bird gratifies its appetite at leisure. The desire
for this food is an acquired one, as the kea first got its taste for
sheep fat from skins hung on fences and other places to dry.</p>

<p>The islands of New Zealand are divided by Cook's Straits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
which are 40 miles wide. One section, lying south of Cook's
Straits, is known as South Island, and the land north of the
straits is termed North Island. We have been traveling in
South Island, which is far richer.</p>

<p>Port Lyttleton, the port for Christchurch, is located nine
miles from the metropolis. Boats run to Wellington daily, the
sailing time being ten hours.</p>

<p>One man one vote, and one woman one vote, is the scope of
franchise New Zealand offers. Parliament is composed of 70
members, elected for three years. Several political parties exist
in the Dominion, and the one in power chooses from among the
Assembly a successor for the Premiership. Although the Premier
is the responsible head of the government, over him is an
imperial official, a governor-general, from the British Isles, who
is appointed by the King of England. New Zealand, in common
with other colonies of the British Empire, pays the governor-general's
salary. The Cook group of islands, located
1,800 miles northeast of Wellington in the Southern Pacific
Ocean, is a dependency of New Zealand, and its affairs are administered
by the Dominion Parliament.</p>

<p>Previous mention has been made of a good railway station in
Dunedin, and that nearly completed the substantial government
buildings seen when that country was visited. We also commented
on the poor accommodation furnished second-class passengers
on railway trains, though paying two cents a mile. A
wooden building&mdash;if it has not since been replaced&mdash;"the
largest wooden office building in the world," is pointed out to
visitors to Wellington. A government office building in the
capital of a country&mdash;built of wood! The worst public building
in the splendid city of Christchurch was the government
railway station; the station at Wellington would not make a
decent sheep shed. With passenger and freight rates sufficient,
and a heavy import duty collected on most commodities entering
the country, together with an annual tax on incomes of
$1,500 and over, the dearth of creditable public buildings, and
the inferior railway accommodation afforded second-class passengers,
would seem to suggest that government management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
did not bear the mark of striking efficiency. On the other hand,
the people are thrifty, courteous, kind, congenial and mostly
in good circumstances.</p>

<p>The business portion of Wellington is built at the bottom of
a chain of high hills, with a splendid harbor front. These hills
are so steep that stairways and cable lines figure largely as utilities
by which residents reach their homes. One misses the convenient
squares and parks found in other centers in that part
of the world, but the absence of these here is accounted for by
lack of room, as the space between the butts of the hills and
the docks is limited even for business purposes. Some distance
from the business center, however, is a good botanical garden,
and in another direction are creditable parks, with sports
grounds included, which enable the capital to make a fair showing
in this particular.</p>

<p>Most of the dwellings are of wood, and rents are, like the
hills surrounding the city, high. The weekly system of paying
bills is customary here. Some of these homes, for which $25
and $35 a month rent is paid, are difficult to reach, even after
one has alighted from a cable car. Rents are higher in Wellington
than in any city of Australasia. Wages, too, are comparatively
low. Laborers receive no more than in cities where rent
is much cheaper. Mechanics receive about $3 a day.</p>

<p>One cannot but observe the trend of industrial advancement
in almost every quarter of the globe visited. It is a very dull
place, indeed, where houses or buildings of some sort are not
under course of construction. In Wellington the sound of
hammer and saw is heard in valleys and on hillsides miles away
from the city. Landlords squeezed their tenants so hard that
the government was finally induced to help the citizens by advancing
money with which to build homes on sites some distance
from the capital.</p>

<p>Arbitration courts fix wages, but that system of settling disputes
between employer and employe works out better in theory
than in practice, judging from the number of strikes that so
frequently take place. Anyway, one clause of this law is very
effective&mdash;if a man works for an employer for a less wage than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
had been fixed by the court, both employer and employe are
fined.</p>

<p>Double-decked street cars are in use in Wellington, as in
cities of the South Island. A few cars run on Sunday up to
2 o'clock in the afternoon. The fare up to that hour being 12
cents, persons going to and from church might have reason to
pinch on the contribution to make up for excessive street-car
charges. The custom is hard to explain. Certainly, it is too
far to walk from some of the valleys to the city, but, as a limited
number of cars are run for the convenience of churchgoers, why
this overcharge? It is possible church-going people have a Sunday
commutation ticket; if so, non-churchgoers who patronize
the cars would pay the freight.</p>

<p>Gas costs $1.80 a thousand feet here. A private company
controls this commodity.</p>

<p>Wellington, with a population of 75,000, is the chief seaport
of New Zealand. In addition to being located in the
center of the two islands, its good, land-locked harbor, deep
enough to admit vessels of great draught, adds greatly to its
commercial prestige. Big vessels plying between England and
New Zealand dock and start from here.</p>

<p>Meat is no dearer than in other New Zealand cities&mdash;6 to 12
cents a pound. Telegraph messages cost but 12 cents for 12
words.</p>

<p>The government pays pensions to citizens who have reached
the age of 65 years and whose incomes do not exceed $240 a
year. This rate is the same as is paid in Australia&mdash;$2.40 a
week each to husband and wife.</p>

<p>The Town Hall, with other municipal and business buildings,
is a creditable one, and its auditorium and balconies are
packed with people who attend the Sunday evening concerts,
furnished by the city, which do not begin until church services
are over. A good museum is another attraction. Little in
favor of the streets can be said, however, for they are poorly
laid out and are not kept as tidy as those in other cities.</p>

<p>Newspapers are well up to the mark for the size of the city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and had I been short of funds, I could have kept my head
above water, as I was offered work here.</p>

<p>The standard of law and order maintained in the Island
Dominion may be inferred when it is mentioned that there are
no keys to doors in some hotels. When shown to a room at one
place the absence of a key was brought to the attention of the
clerk. "There are no keys to any of the rooms," he explained,
in a matter-of-fact manner. Notwithstanding high
rents and the high price of gas, hotel expenses were only $1.20
a day.</p>

<p>Pelorus Jack, the pilot fish, lives on the other side of Cook's
Straits from Wellington. Like the kea bird and the kiwi, he
is in a class by himself&mdash;the most remarkable fish in the world.
He is perhaps the only pilot that ever lived who knows nothing
about the science of navigation. Pelorus Jack belongs to the
dolphin family. His length is about 14 feet, and he is bluish-white
in color. His home is in Pelorus Sound, and the channel
from that body of water to Nelson is very tortuous. Where
the channel becomes dangerous for ships, Jack will be found,
waiting. When a vessel reaches the mouth of the channel, the
dolphin sallies forth, faithfully following the curves of the
route, and the ship is steered in accordance with his trail. Outgoing
vessels are also met by this remarkable fish, who precedes
the ship until it has reached safe water. The Maoris aver
that Jack has lived in these parts for generations, and in their
eyes he is an ocean god. An act of Parliament was passed in
1904 protecting all fish of that species in New Zealand waters.
As Jack is probably the only fish of his sort living in Cook's
Straits, he enjoys the exclusive protection of the legislative
decree.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>Traveling up a steep grade from Wellington, and then
down the mountain on the other side of the range, the train
pulled away from the coast and headed northward, speeding
over the trunk line between the capital and Auckland. Passing
through tidy towns, then over trestles spanning rippling streams,
through bushy glens, ornamented with attractive fern trees&mdash;queen
of flora here&mdash;which have no superior as a natural
adornment, we entered stretches of lava wakes, covered with
a bracken growth. To the right, Mount Ruapehu, 9,000 feet
high, with its snow-capped summit, came to view; then Mounts
Ngauruhoe and Tongariro, lower mountains than Ruapehu,
appear. We next came to the King country&mdash;Maoriland;
later a stop was made at Francton Junction, where a change of
cars was made, and then headed for Rotorua, the main attraction
of the thermal district of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Rotorua is a place where people come on crutches and leaning
on walking sticks, and a great number of these, on taking
their departure from the sulphur laden air of that district, leave
their crutches and walking-sticks behind.</p>

<p>The New Zealand government owns this part of Geyserland,
and too much credit cannot be given for the splendid place that
has been made out of what was formerly a lava-bestrewn stretch
of land on the shore of the blue waters of Lake Rotorua.
Broad streets, shaded with beautiful avenues of trees; electric
lights, gardens and parks, handsome bath buildings, grounds
for light sports and free music every day, are some good things
the government furnishes. Board can be had for from $5 to
$7 a week, and sulphur baths&mdash;the water boiling out of the
ground&mdash;cost only 12 cents, including a towel. The Rotorua
wells have proved heaven-sent blessings to many an afflicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
soul. After taking a few baths the flesh assumes a velvety
softness.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to note the improvement in the condition of
a crippled person who had reached Rotorua on crutches. In
a few days one crutch sufficed; in a similar time that crutch had
been discarded; a walking stick next answered the purpose of
support, and, finally, with a beaming face and a buoyant heart,
that same person, whose legs had been distorted for years from
rheumatism or some other cause, could be seen walking about
the pretty lawns or shaded streets, unsupported by either stick
or crutch, with bright eyes and a radiant countenance, at peace
with all mankind, and prepared to face the battle of life again
with limber limbs and a grateful heart.</p>

<p>The geysers of Rotorua&mdash;real high spouters&mdash;cannot compare
with those of Yellowstone Park. From the shore of the
lake, for half a mile back, the ground was marked at close
spaces with gurgling, bubbling and steaming wells, and a strong
sulphurous smell is nearly always present. One feature of that
section of Geyserland, however, surpasses any of Yellowstone&mdash;a
large mud pool, called Tikitere. It is really a volcano,
and the furious, boiling, bursting, smoking pond of sulphuric
mud commands unusual attention.</p>

<p>Half a dozen lakes are linked together, each from five to
twelve miles in length, the sides heavily verdured with an evergreen
growth, and high hills rising in every direction, making the
trip through the lakes very interesting. One of these, Rotomahana,
is a boiling body of water. Launches travel through this
steam-laden lake with as apparent safety and comfort as through
normal waters. The shores contain numerous and deep fissures,
steam coming from these openings in great clouds. Both lake
and shores present a scene like that after a big fire, when nothing
but smoke remains.</p>

<p>A small Pompeii is among the attractions of this thermal district.
The place is known as Te Wairoa, and was overwhelmed
in 1886 by heavy showers of mud and volcanic ash
ejected from the volcano Tarawera. Over a hundred natives
and four Europeans were buried under the mud and lava. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
ruins of the settlement&mdash;buildings, wagons and other evidences
of habitation&mdash;are yet to be seen. Ashes and cinders ejected
from the volcano at that time were carried for a distance of
60 miles.</p>

<p>At Whakarewarewa, a short distance from Rotorua, is where
the greatest subterranean disturbance takes place. Quite a
number of geysers are located at that center, but none of the
high-spouters were "working." The "crack" or "show"
geyser of that basin is Wairo. It seems to have imbibed the
easy-going spirit of the Maoris, for it will "work" only on
State occasions. For instance, if the governor-general of New
Zealand were to visit Rotorua, and later "Whaka," as that
long name is called for short, Wairo would be set to
"working." The geyser is coaxed into action by throwing
quantities of soap into the well. Visitors would willingly contribute
money to buy soap to set Wairo working, but as the
geyser is covered with heavy planks, a prison cell would be the
reward of a person tampering with the pet "spouter." It is
said that water is forced to a height of 100 feet when Wairo
gets into harness.</p>

<p>Vegetation suffers when coming in contact with the outpourings
of the Yellowstone geysers, while about Rotorua the
steam and sulphuric atmosphere from the steaming wells does
not seem to interfere with the growth of flora. Jewelry and
silver and gold coins become black while visiting that district,
the sulphur in the air having this effect on metal.</p>

<p>Guides showing visitors about that district are Maori women,
the price for their services being fixed by the government, together
with launch charges for sails on the lakes. It is a good
system, for one then knows beforehand how much money a trip
will cost.</p>

<p>New Zealand, unlike Australia, is rife with battle cries, war
songs and narratives of native bravery. Most of the trouble
had its inception from land-grabbing by white men, and they
have succeeded well, although the natives' domain is still large.
Like most natives, the Maori is not blessed with a great amount
of ambition, and his needs are common and small, being favored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
with a good climate, as the weather in the North Island is
moderate the year round.</p>

<p>The Maori is not a native of New Zealand, but what race of
people inhabited that country previous to his settlement history
does not record. It is safe to presume he killed off the aborigines,
as he would not brook much interference from an inferior
race. The Maori is the Polynesian, and in 1350 he paddled
and rowed in canoes across a stretch of sea for a distance of
1,700 miles&mdash;from the island of Raratonga, one of the Cook
group, to New Zealand. From that time until New Zealand's
gradual settlement he held undisputed sway. In color he is
similar to an American Indian, and is inclined to fleshiness.</p>

<p>New Zealanders are very proud of the Maori. While of a
warring race, he is not a criminal. He can be made a friend&mdash;can
be trusted. Intermarriages take place frequently, and it is
said the white party to the transaction meets with no social
discrimination. Civilization has proved detrimental to them, as
with most natives, however, and is diminishing their numbers
from time to time. Consumption is decimating them fast.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch Maori women, with their babes
on their backs, cooking food and baking bread by the heat from
boiling springs, so numerous about the shores of Lake Rotorua.
A board box, large enough to admit a kettle, is placed in a well,
and an iron grating put at the bottom to rest it on. Meat, fish,
vegetables or anything to be cooked is put in the kettle. A
blanket is placed over this to keep the steam from escaping.
When the food is cooked, the kettle is taken out and the meal
served. Dough is placed in them also, and the bread is well
baked. Dried shark meat is much eaten by Maoris.</p>

<p>Like all South Sea Islanders, he is fond of the water, indulging
in bathing, swimming and aquatic sports. The Maori
still maintains the skill with large canoes that enabled his forefathers
to paddle 1,700 miles over the Pacific, from Raratonga
to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Tattooing is a very noticeable custom of these people.
Women are tattooed more generally than men. It used to be the
other way. When the custom began to die out with the men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the women took it up, and it is they who keep it alive. The
marks are made by a dark blue liquid&mdash;the sap of a certain
tree. The forehead and chin are the places where the marks
are mostly made. Tattooing does not improve the women's
looks, but they will not allow old fashions to die out. The
woman is generally the man's master.</p>

<p>Maoris are a proud and independent race, considering themselves
on an equal with the white man. In order that their
"equality" may be maintained, they will not act as servants of
the white race. One could not induce a Maori girl to do
housework for a European for any wage, neither would a
Maori boy black a white man's shoes. They have a vote on any
measure affecting their interest, but Dominion suffrage ends
there. Four Maoris represent their race in Parliament. The
immigration laws of this country practically prohibiting, by a
high tax, Asiatic and all other black and colored races from
entering, the Maori is the only colored inhabitant in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Any land Maoris sell must be sold to the government and
disposed of as it sees fit. The government forwards to the
natives the interest on the principal from these sales when they
are in need of funds. They prefer to work in the sheep-shearing
period, which lasts a month to six weeks, during which they
can earn from $8 to $10 a day. As a rule, they do not want a
steady job.</p>

<p>Native women wear a charm, called tiki&mdash;a flat, green
stone, one to three inches in width and from two to four inches
in length. It is a weird image, carved in the stone, having a
big, lop-sided head and unevenly shaped body. This ornament
is worn on their chest. A small hole is bored in the top of the
tiki, through which a string is passed, and, when the ends are
tied, the loop is placed around the neck.</p>

<p>Many Maori women smoke pipes. They are a religious
race, and before entering a church they lift the pipes from their
mouths and place them on a railing or a step outside. When
the service is finished, each one, on leaving the building, stoops
and picks up her pipe, lights it, and heads for her home.

<p>Homeless white babies and children need not be a charge on a
municipality where there is a Maori settlement. Natives will
take all the white foundlings that are offered them. As they
are an honest race, white children are not only well looked
after, but are taught good principles also.</p>

<p>Rubbing noses and shaking hands is the mode of greeting
when Maori meets Maori, and their offspring learn that custom
early. As a mother, carrying her child on her back, bends
to "burnish" noses with a friend, the children seem to lean to
one side and watch their mammas carry out this old Maori
mode of greeting.</p>

<p>Pakeha is the native word for white people, and when white
persons speak of native and white, pakeha and native are the
distinguishing terms used.</p>

<p>Visitors to Rotorua are afforded much amusement by native
dances and hakas. Women engage in the poi dance, which is a
series of motions, gone through to the accompaniment of
a concertina. In the hands of each woman is a ball of grass
as large as a peach, with a grass string attached. Time is kept
with these as they come in contact with the other hand, and
when a dozen strike in unison a shuffling sound results. The
grass or flax ball is termed the poi. Men only take part in the
haka, which is a war dance, and a good one, too. An extended
account of the Maori and his customs would make interesting
reading. They number less than 50,000.</p>

<p>Kaikai is the name they give to food in New Zealand. Grub,
scoff, tucker, and kaikai is the collection of food names to this
point.</p>

<p>We now take leave of this pretty place, where crutches,
walking-sticks, and invalid chairs are converted into kindling
wood; where pain evaporates with the sulphurous odors, and
men are made anew by bathing in that far-off pool of Siloam&mdash;where,
as Langhorne so beautifully puts it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Affliction flies, and hope returns,"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>and start for Auckland.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand, having a population
of 85,000, and was the busiest we had visited. This is
another leg-straining place, but not so hilly as Dunedin or
Wellington. Ships from the South Sea Islands are arriving and
departing continually, as Auckland has a big trade with these
groups. Most of the shipping between Australia and New
Zealand passes through Auckland; many large steamships from
Europe also head for this port.</p>

<p>The rosy-cheeked women and children and the healthy appearance
of New Zealanders generally is a feature one cannot
fail to observe. Besides, there are few poor people&mdash;none
wearing ragged clothes, certainly&mdash;every one tidy in appearance
and well dressed. Few foreign-speaking people live in
Auckland&mdash;90 per cent, are Britishers&mdash;and all have a fair
education. Schooling advantages are good.</p>

<p>The city is well supplied with parks; also a splendid museum
and an art gallery are among the assets of that busy, far-off
place. Auckland's street car system is the only one privately
owned in New Zealand. Unlike Melbourne's, though, it is
fast and modern.</p>

<p>The winter climate of Auckland proves a magnet to those
living in colder parts of the Dominion. It is semi-tropical and
has an invigorating atmosphere.</p>

<p>The dwellings are mostly frame-built, two stories high, and
from $15 to $20 a month rent is charged. Wages do not exceed
$3 a day for mechanics and $2 a day for laborers. Meat,
on the other hand, is reasonable, ranging in price from 6 to 12
cents a pound.</p>

<p>Servant girls have a union in New Zealand, and their wages
run from $4 to $5 a week. After quitting time, the lady of
the house must finish any work that has not been completed.
A smart New Zealand girl does the work of three African
house servants.</p>

<p>The degrading occupation of barmaid was noticeable in
New Zealand, as in most British colonies. But that kind of
work for women will gradually come to an end in the Island
Dominion, as an act was passed forbidding saloonkeepers hiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
barmaids. Those that were engaged at that work when the
act was passed were allowed to remain, but when a barmaid
leaves the proprietor must fill the vacancy with a man. As
temperance has gained a strong foothold, it is not likely that, in
the near future, there will be work of that sort for either women
or men.</p>

<p>Punishment by lashes for certain offenses committed by men
is a law of New Zealand, the number administered being from
one to fifty.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants of Australasia are tea drinkers&mdash;tea for
breakfast, tea for luncheon, and tea for dinner. Mutton and
lamb chops are the meat standbys.</p>

<p>The government has sadly neglected Auckland in public
buildings. For a lively business place, and the largest city in
the Dominion, the railway station was a disgrace; it was little
better than the one at Wellington, but this comparison adds
nothing to the Auckland Station.</p>

<p>When the American fleet visited New Zealand, the sailors
took a fancy to blankets made in that country, and before they
left the hospitable shores of the Dominion every blanket in
stock had been bought. The visit of the United States battleships
here some years ago proved an epoch-making event.</p>

<p>New Zealanders are very patriotic, but often, when they have
visited Australian cities and rested their eyes on the splendid
buildings and grand parks there, and quaffed a few draughts of
metropolitan air that pervades some centers of that country,
they are in no hurry to return. New Zealand is the best place
in the world until the New Zealander visits Australia.</p>

<p>Coastwise shipping, both in New Zealand and in Australia,
is conducted on a similar basis to that of the United States. A
steamer leaving New Zealand for Africa or Europe, or any
foreign port, and stopping at an Australian port to take on oversea
cargo, is not allowed to carry either freight or passengers
from New Zealand to Australia. The same rule applies to
vessels coming from foreign ports that stop at Australian ports
with their destination a New Zealand port. Sailors and firemen
employed on coastwise ships are paid double the wages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
sailors on oversea ships, the same as paid sailors employed on
American ships&mdash;$40 and $45 a month.</p>

<p>One steamship company has cornered almost all the shipping
there is in that part of the world. It is a four days' sail from
Auckland to Sydney, and the first-class fare is $37. If a
passenger received first-class accommodation there would be less
fault to find with the high charge. A cabin contains six
berths, and these are nearly always occupied, as travel is heavy
between the two centers. What would any one paying first-class
fare on a steamship plying between the United States and
Europe think if shown a cabin containing six berths, all of them
taken? One has no choice in Australasia. Second-class accommodation
on the ships of that line is not so good as third-class
on the European liners.</p>

<p>The duty on some American exports&mdash;grain binders, motor
cars, manufactured and raw material for various uses&mdash;is 25
to 60 per cent. The duty on tobacco, most of it shipped from
America, is 84 cents a pound.</p>

<p>Auckland is very attractive by reason of her good harbor and
the elevated character of land, on which the greater portion of
the city is built.</p>

<p>Gold is profitably mined in both the North and South Islands.</p>

<p>The newspaper industry is well represented in Auckland, and
fully measures up to the place. One will find more news from
the United States printed in Auckland papers than in any other
newspapers in Australasia.</p>

<p>New Zealanders are to be commended for their fair treatment
of strangers. Travelers, particularly those from foreign
lands, pay no more for hotel accommodation and articles bought
than is charged local tourists. Every one seems to be interested
in a stranger's welfare, not for what money they can extort from
him, but from a purely Christian spirit. No petty overcharges
were imposed&mdash;no one seemed bent on getting more out of a
visitor than was just. We wish them well.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>After a four days' sail over the Tasman Sea we reached
Sydney, Australia, where, after several weeks' stay, we counted
our money. Five dollars a day was our basis of expenses, but,
as hotel rates had not exceeded $1.50 a day in Australasia, we
found ourselves with a surplus of over a hundred dollars, for
our expenses had been only $4 a day instead of $5. A very
enticing trip, taking several weeks, was advertised to Fiji,
Samoa, and the Tonga Islands for $125. We could spare $100,
but feared that the other $25 might result in our being held in
Australia at a time when we had promised to be in South
Africa. However, we bought a ticket for the South Sea
Islands trip, and took the chance of a shortage.</p>

<p>The ship was packed with passengers going to Fiji, as the
sugar season had just begun. The first suggestion of the
demoralization that accompanies living in the tropics was observed
here. Whisky-and-soda, whisky-and-soda, all the day
and a good part of the night, seemed to be the main "amusement"
indulged in by many of the Islanders. This pronounced
phase of tropical life does not apply to any particular
white race&mdash;people of every nation travel the same road.</p>

<p>After six days' sail from Sydney the ship was angling about
treacherous coral reefs, and before us were fields of bright green
color&mdash;the sugar-cane; several buildings with smokestacks
rising above&mdash;the sugar mill; one-story frame houses dotted
here and there; the shores attractive with cocoanut palms, and
just behind stretches of broad banana leaves, the tops of grass
and leaf-built huts showing now and again through the foliage,
were the unerring suggestions that the balmy tropics had been
reached.</p>

<p>How savage these strange people, standing on the wharf at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Lautoka, looked! The stiff hair was pointing upward for six
inches from their heads, some so bushy that the bottom of a
washtub would be none too large to accommodate the moplike,
hairy spread. Tall, and of athletic build, their features
flat and negroid, copper or black in color, with muscles standing
out from legs and arms, their flesh shining from the frequent
use of cocoanut-oil, and with a cloth about their waist extending
to the knees, there stood the redeemed cannibals.</p>

<p>Their hair is black and kinky, but among groups of Fijis may
be seen hair of a dark, reddish color, and, again, others are
completely plastered with white mud. The plaster is coral
lime, used to change the color, which accounts for the reddish-colored
mops. Dyeing the hair is only a fad with a native,
however, for he later on becomes tired of his reddish locks, when
he will apply a black dye, the hair again becoming its natural
color. In a few days the coral lime will change the hair from
black to brown, or reddish. He rubs himself with cocoanut-oil
every day, which gives his body and limbs a polished appearance.
That daily massage largely accounts for his muscles
standing out so prominently and also for his splendid
build. Besides, he puts in a great deal of time bathing and
swimming, which exercise will add strength to any one. In
diving he excels perhaps any race in the world, for going to
depths of from 35 to 40 feet is a common pastime with him.</p>

<p>The Fijis' mode of dealing with each other is communistic.
A sailing boat may be seen tied to the trunk of a cocoanut
palm. All the natives in that district having contributed to
the building of the craft, when one wished to use the boat there
was no protest from other members of the community. The
same principle applies to money; when a Fiji has earned, say,
$5, he shares with others who may be in need.</p>

<p>One day a week is about all he cares to work, but he will
make a sacrifice of his scruples occasionally by working two
days, when, for instance, a ship is being loaded or unloaded. He
receives 50 cents a day, with board, for that labor. On the
wharf are portions of food&mdash;sandwiches, biscuits, meat, and
other eatables&mdash;for each native employed by the ship's company.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Sitting on their haunches, they devour their allotted
portion at "Smoke, ho," time.</p>

<p>Numbers of them gather at a wharf of an evening when a
ship is in port. Soon the tunes of "Shall We Gather at the
River?" "Jesus, Lover of My Soul," "Hold the Fort," and
other well-known hymns fall harmoniously on the balmy air,
the English words having been translated into their language.
No missionary, however, can be sure of his black and brawny
followers, for they think nothing of severing their connection
with one denomination and affiliating with any other they think
will better serve them. But all are affiliated with some religious
body. Cannibalism has not been practiced for forty
years. Fijians are a docile and agreeable race.</p>

<p>Unlike his Zulu brother, a Fiji has but one wife, and families,
as a rule, are small, not averaging more than three children.
For some years the birth rate was on the decrease, but
of recent years they have held their own. Some 90,000 natives,
and 40,000 Indians, or Hindus, live in the Fiji group.</p>

<p>Their huts are built of reeds, bamboo poles and cocoanut
trees, the roofs being covered with grass; they have two doors,
but no windows. Not a nail is used in the construction.
Mats, made of cocoanut leaves, are spread about the floor, giving
the inside a neat appearance. Their food is turtle, fish,
yams, taro, boiled green bananas, cocoanut and rice. A small
yam looks like a beet; but some of them grow very large, being
a load for a man to carry. The taro is the root of a plant like
a lily, which grows in swamps. With these growing all around,
combined with the turtles and fish, he is as independent as he
was a thousand years ago. Then there are papaws, breadfruit
and other tropical fruits that furnish all the delicacies he
may desire.</p>

<p>A large sugar mill is located at Lautoka, and the sugar shipment
from the Fiji group is nearly 100,000 tons each season.
The land is very rich, and some of the cane stalks are as large
as a two-inch pipe. Working in the cane fields and mills being
too hard for the Fijian, that work is done by Indian coolies.
Narrow railways are built through the large cane fields, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the stalks are brought to the mills on trucks from the surrounding
plantations. Fiji is the richest of all South Pacific groups.</p>

<p>Free railroad travel is a luxury seldom enjoyed anywhere,
but this is to be found in Fiji. The distance from Lautoka
to Ba is 28 miles, and a railway connects the two points.
There are sugar mills at both places. A concession was granted
to the sugar companies to build a railway from Lautoka to Ba,
with the stipulation that all passengers traveling to and from
these points be carried free of charge. The track is two feet
wide, and the locomotive is as broad as it is high. A small car,
with seats placed across, heads the train, and to this is coupled
several freight trucks. The schedule for the 28 miles is four
hours, but five and six hours is more often the time consumed
in making the journey.</p>

<p>Europeans carrying horse-hair fastened to a stick is the
first odd thing one notices at Lautoka. Flies are very numerous
and stick to one like mosquitoes. The fly-swish is used to keep
"tormentors" from worrying one to death. Australia has
the same breed of insect, but because of the absence of black
servants and black help their hands are occupied with tools of
industry instead of a hair swish with which to insure personal
comfort.</p>

<p>Only 150 Europeans live in Lautoka, and these were engaged
at clerical or managerial employment. Few fat men
were seen, and every one had a bleached appearance.</p>

<p>Suva, capital of the Fiji Islands, is, with Lautoka, located on
the island of Viti Levu, the largest of the group. Abel J.
Tasman, the daring navigator who first set foot on Tasmania
and first saw New Zealand, was also the first white man to
come in touch with these islands, in 1643. They became British
territory in 1874. A governor, appointed by the King of
England, directs the affairs of the group, aided by a legislative
council composed of eighteen members, twelve of whom are
appointed and six elected. Two native representatives are included
in the legislative council. Great Britain recently ceded
the government of these islands to Australia. The Fiji group
are composed of 200 islands, 80 of which are inhabited. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
other islands are small, but cocoanut palms grow on most of
them.</p>

<p>One thousand Europeans live in Suva, and all of them dress
in immaculate white. Business houses are located along the
water-front, and the homes are built on rising hills. These
dwellings rest on posts driven in the ground, are of wood
and one story in height. Large verandas are built to the
homes, and these are enclosed with reeds&mdash;this screen keeping
out the hot sun and allowing the breeze to blow through at the
same time.</p>

<p>Flowers grow everywhere, nature being liberal to Fiji both in
quantity and variety. Leaves on vegetation range from the
size of an ironing-board down to the finest fern-leaf. The
sleeping tree, seen in Suva, is of interest. When the sun has
hid behind the tropical hills the leaves begin to curl, and by
dark they all close. At daylight, the leaves begin to wake, as it
were, and a short time after sunrise they have unfolded to their
full size. One weed or small bush that grows here is a marvel
of the vegetable world. It is called the sensitive plant. If
one looks at it, it seems to shrink away, and the slightest touch
will cause its leaves to shrivel up, as if dead. On leaving the
plant, the leaves slowly expand again. This plant goes to
sleep, too, when the chill of evening falls, but opens at the
first flush of the morning sun.</p>

<p>"The king of plants," the hibiscus, a flower from three to
six inches across, of a bright red and sometimes red and white
color, grows in profusion. Hedges are often made of the
hibiscus, and when in bloom it offers a superior floral scene.
There is no end to flowers in Fiji.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! Look at the black bobbies!" (policemen)
roared a young Britisher when he first saw the Fiji police.
The guardians of peace in Fiji are termed constabulary, and
natives compose the force. They wear a bushy head of hair, as
does the civilian native, have bare feet and polished legs. Their
uniform is a blue jacket, or tunic, and white sulu (a kilt), the
latter scalloped or vandyked round the edges. Natives prefer
police duty or soldiering to all other work. Unlike the Zulu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
he scorns domestic service, and field labor does not appeal to
him. A bright red hibiscus, or another flower of flaring hue,
may be seen sticking in his hair at the side. Thus the Suva
policeman looks neat, and is certainly noticeable.</p>

<p>The best building in Suva is a library, donated by a Scotch
philanthropist. It is built of cement. Little can be said of
the government buildings; yet in this small place is a botanical
garden large cities would be proud of.</p>

<p>Copra (dried cocoanut) is shipped in considerable quantities
from Suva. Brought from adjacent islands in small sailing
boats, it is loaded on vessels at the capital port. A cocoanut
tree produces a dollar's worth of copra yearly. Forty trees
is the number generally planted to the acre. Eight years' time
is required from planting until bearing. The trees require
very little care, and, if not blown down by storms, will yield
for a hundred years.</p>

<p>It is marvelous to what uses the cocoanut tree and its fruit
can be put. Besides being a staple food of natives, the pulp,
together with cocoanut oil, is made into cakes for cattle, particularly
dairy cows. The pulp contains 40 per cent. nutriment,
and both increased quantity and richness of milk result when a
cow is fed with these cakes. There is a demand for this food
in Australia. Soap is also made of the cocoanut, together with
candies, and preparations for cooking purposes claim a large
portion of the product. The coir, or fibers, and cocoanut leaves
are used to make mats, baskets, scrub brushes, brooms, fans,
pillows, for thatching houses, making rope and twine, and in
many other ways the cocoanut tree and its product serve as
articles of utility.</p>

<p>The Fijian believes that the food that tickles his palate
should also be relished by the white man. When one stops at
a native's home it would be better to forget for the time being
that he is a white. Fijians are very hospitable, and share with
a white visitor the best they have. It makes no difference how
the native food may look, smell or taste, if a white man refuses
to partake of the hospitality offered the native will be
offended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>From 40,000 to 50,000 Indian coolies live in these rich islands,
most of whom work in the sugar-cane fields. Then
there are what is known as the Solomon Island "boys," in considerable
numbers in Fiji, engaged at the same work. The
Fijian will not do hard work if he has a chance to run away.
Indians are brought to Fiji under the indenture system for a
term of five years. At the end of the indentureship, though,
they may remain in Fiji. Herein a similar blunder was made
in Natal, South Africa. Indians will eventually own the sections
of Fiji worth having; then natives, white men, and all
others will have no chance to make a living.</p>

<p>Some 500 lepers are detained on one island; but there was no
leprosy in Fiji, nor other bad diseases affecting the group before
Indians were imported to work in the sugar fields. From six
to ten Indians are hanged here every month; but there were
very few hangings before Indians came. When sending out
packs of indentured coolies the Indian government apportions
one woman to three men; this may explain the monthly hangings.</p>

<p>"Everybody in town knows what's in the papers before they
come out," remarked a resident when speaking of the Suva
newspapers. Two are printed in the Fiji capital, each appearing
three times a week. As editions appear on alternate days,
Suva enjoys the luxury of a daily. Business men seem to be
well satisfied with the publishers' efforts, for, out of 28 columns
contained in each of the tri-weeklies, 20 columns were advertisements.
Considering population, high cable charges, etc., Suva's
newspapers outstrip anything we can recall; they sell at six
cents a copy.</p>

<p>All natives go to church on Sunday morning. Each one has
a Bible or hymn book carefully wrapped in a cloth or paper.
Men and women are dressed in their best, the men mostly in
white jackets and sulus (kilts), wearing vari-colored neckwear.
Women wear cheap picture hats or go bareheaded. With the
latter style go fronds of delicate ferns, artistically woven in
the hair, or plaited together along with a pretty hibiscus or
other flaring flower. The natives not only look attractive, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
their demeanor commands respect. Their singing is of fair
quality, and they put their heart in their efforts.</p>

<p>The English money system&mdash;shillings and pounds&mdash;is the
one in use in the Fiji group. Hotel expenses were $2 to $3 a
day.</p>

<p>All barriers and shoals in the sea in that part of the world
are termed coral reefs. Beautiful specimens are brought to the
steamships by natives to sell to passengers. The natural color
of the coral is brown, which becomes white when bleached in
the sun. Then there are big shells that are beauties&mdash;some
so large they could not go in a water pail. One variety of pearl
shell&mdash;cici&mdash;found in the vicinity of Suva has developed into
quite an industry. A ton weight of these sell from $125 to
$150. They are as large as a goose egg. The Fijian dives
for these among the reefs, a kind of work that suits him to a
T. These shells are shipped to pearl merchants in China.</p>

<p>On the island of Mbau, situated not far from Suva, is the
ancient capital of Fiji, where all who may be termed aristocratic
in Fiji live. It was here the last king, Cakobau the
Terrible, lived, died and was buried. Kandavu Levu, the
greatest of the Fijian lords and the grandson of Cakobau, now
lives in the old cannibal king's stronghold. He receives a
pension from the British government. The Fijian princess,
Andi Cakobau, the grand-daughter of King Cakobau, is also
among the high-bred Fijian residents at Mbau.</p>

<p>Sixty miles further a stop was made at Levuka, on the island
of Ovalau, as pretty a settlement as one could wish to see.
Only 250 Europeans live in this place, but all seemed prosperous.
These are mostly traders, and it would surprise one
to see the varied assortment of goods in the stores. Roofs of
houses are painted red, and the residences are surrounded by
cocoanut palms, papaw trees, and bananas. There are flowers
everywhere&mdash;even the shrubbery bears flowers.</p>

<p>A short distance from Levuka we came to a native village.
Between the front rows of huts was a street, 150 feet wide,
covered with grass. On visiting one of the huts, the husband
pointed to a bed, which consisted of a dozen mats piled on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
floor, inviting me to sit down. A moment later he bethought
himself of the baby sleeping in the part of the bed where he
had invited me to sit. He pointed to a little mound under the
mats, laughed, and indicated that I sit in another place. Scanning
the tidy enclosure, to my surprise, a large picture of Jeffries,
the ex-prizefighter, hung from one side. It pleased the
native to see the interest I took in the poster, for he laughed
aloud, and, pointing to it, said something that sounded like
"Ugh!"</p>

<p>Visiting another hut, it was also found very neat, the floor
being covered with cocoanut mats; the mat bed was the visitor's
seat here also. This Fijian could speak no English, and we
had not been long enough in the islands to acquire a speaking
knowledge of the native language. At our approach the wife
came to the center of the hut, but a few moments later, much
to our surprise, she sat on the floor and began turning a handle
to an American-made hand sewing machine that rested on a
soap box.</p>

<p>It is possible for a Fijian to march 40 miles a day, heavily
loaded, without food; but sometimes he takes twelve hours to
travel only twelve miles, and eats half a dozen big meals during
the journey. He is said to have a more pronounced weakness
for yanggona, the native liquor, than have any other of the
South Sea Islanders. This beverage is made from the root of
a tree and, when drunk to excess, intoxicates. Each native
must pay a yearly government tax of $5.</p>

<p>So that the reader may gather some idea of the scope of the
planet on which we live, it may be of interest to note, before
leaving Levuka, that this small port is located 11 hours and
59 minutes east of Greenwich, England, from which point the
time of the world is computed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>Traveling through still, blue-water channels, resembling
wide esplanades, if the term be allowed, formed by heavily
verdured tropical islands on each side, with curly coral reefs
peeping out of the sea from time to time, we sailed for 150
miles through what may be termed an ocean park, when the
ship entered the Koro Sea, and two days later reached the
Samoan Islands. Sixty miles east of Levuka we crossed the
line of the 180th meridian, where time changes 12 hours.</p>

<p>A red stream of lava, running from the mouth of a volcano
down a mountain course 15 miles in length, and emptying into
the sea, is a strange phenomenon. This volcano is located on
the island of Savaii, the largest of the Samoan group. The distance
from the shore to the mouth of the crater is seven miles,
but the circuitous course of the stream is double the direct distance.
The volcano burst into activity in 1905, and a foreshore
of lava a quarter of a mile in extent bears evidence of the
crater's outpourings since that time. In daytime the molten
stream is white, and at night it resembles a great flaring serpent
as it angles its way about rocky obstructions down the mountainside
to the sea. Not far from the shore the lava bored a
tunnel through a hillock that interfered for a time with its
flow, and day and night the stream is red when passing through
that opening. The cloud of steam that rises as the lava enters
the water resembles a great volume of spray from a large waterfall.
It is said the sea is a mile deep where this lava stream
empties into the Pacific Ocean. Ships stop opposite the crater
to allow passengers to view this unusual spectacle.</p>

<p>Passing through a coral reef channel, we arrived in the
harbor of Apia, capital of the Samoan Islands. The little
town stretches along the bay, cocoanut palms lining the shore
at places, the trees and heavily verdured hills in the foreground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
giving the Samoan capital a high position in the list of pretty
places. The ship was soon surrounded by natives, who offered
for sale fans, shells, corals, beads and flowers.</p>

<p>The Samoan is the native aristocrat of all peoples. In bearing,
looks, manners, tidiness, hospitality and pride he leads the
world. He is the Polynesian, together with the Maori, the
Tongan (Friendly Islander), the Kanaka (of Hawaii), and
other tribes living on some of the South Pacific islands. The
Samoans number 40,000, about 500 Europeans living in the
group.</p>

<p>If one should reach Apia on Sunday he would be apt to find
the hair on the heads of a majority of men a yellow and reddish
color; and were one to stop at the same port on a Tuesday or
Wednesday the hair would be black, the natural color. Coral
lime will change the color of hair in two or three days, when he
puts on his best lava-lava (kilt; sulu in Fiji), the light-colored
hair indicating he is dressed up. The hair is straight, and
worn brushed back. The lava-lava is often a bath towel with
red stripes. From his waist up he is bare, and he wears no
shoes. From waist-line to the cap of the knee he is tattooed.
His skin is a gold-bronze color, and he walks with a princely
step, but not a swagger stride. Natives are of good size, but
not so strongly built as the Zulus.</p>

<p>Samoan women are noted for their beauty, and their comeliness
measures up to this coveted distinction not only among the
South Sea Islands races, but of native races of the world. They
wear the lava-lava, as the men, together with a loose-fitting
waist, with short, loose sleeves. Wrappers, however, are sometimes
worn. The clothing worn on the islands is made with
the object of affording comfort. The hair generally presents
a tidy appearance. Flowers, ferns or leaves are often seen
deftly placed in the folds of the thick black hair of Samoan
women, which usually shines from a liberal application of cocoanut
oil. Garlands, worn about the neck, also play a part in
their dress. These are sometimes composed of orange blossoms,
buds of other flowers, berry-like seeds from trees, small seashells,
pits from certain fruits, or of pieces of bone resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
teeth of wild beasts. As a rule, their expressions are pleasing,
and they have a healthy appearance. Some wear sandals, but
most natives are in their bare feet. As with the wearing apparel
of most races, the lava-lavas and waists are not all of the
same color, but vary according to the fancy of the wearer; and
the seed of fancy and caprice seems to be implanted in the
hearts of women of all races, as manifested not only by the
different colors of the lava-lava, but also by the patterns of
silks, sealskins, feathers, and precious stones, as the case may be.</p>

<p>These natives are too proud to unload ships, so Nieu "boys,"
natives from the Savage Islands, are carried from port to port
to do the work. Each Samoan owns a small piece of land, and
the copra, cocoa, bananas and other tropical products from this
amply supply his needs.</p>

<p>When eating in a Samoan's hut a mat is spread for the visitor
to sit on. Another mat is placed before the visitor, which might
be termed a tablecloth. A banana-leaf plate, placed on the
second mat, may contain a baked fish or perhaps a pigeon.
Still another dinner mat, with a banana-leaf plate, contains
greens, the taro leaf, and cocoanut cream; then there may be a
third course, with mat and "plate," containing a native delicacy.
The native beverage, kava, is served in a cocoanut shell by one
of the daughters. All the while chatting is going on and compliments
paid the visitor by the family through an interpreter,
if one cannot speak their language. Sipping liquid is not a
custom in Samoa; but swallowing whatever is offered in the
nature of drink at one gulp, and then sending the cup spinning
back across the mat to the person who served it, is proper.
One is supposed to sit cross-legged on a mat during the meal.</p>

<p>Most of the natives seemed to own a horse and buggy, and
no signs of poverty are apparent. People are in no hurry in
Samoa, which may account for the term, "The land of delicious
idleness." The weather is hot, never below 90 degrees in the
shade, and hovers about the 100 mark. The temperature does
not vary 10 degrees all the year round.</p>

<p>For miles around Apia is a great botanical garden. It is
said the best cocoanut palms grow in Samoa; bananas grow as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
prolific as weeds; the broad-leafed cocoa tree, with its large,
purple-covered pods, covers large areas; the papaw, or mummy
apple, is seen at every turn; coffee bushes are a luxurious
growth; pineapples, mango trees, breadfruit trees, with broad
leaves and rough skin&mdash;any tree or plant that grows in the
tropics may be found in Samoa. The exports from that port
are chiefly copra and cocoa. Samoa is the only place in the
South Sea Islands where cocoa trees will thrive.</p>

<p>Nobody locks doors at night, and nothing is ever taken
from huts. Calling on an acquaintance who kept a general
store, we found the place filled with Samoans&mdash;not room
enough to move. He had occasion to step to the rear for some
article called for, leaving the goods, which were piled up on the
counters, to the mercy of the natives, and much floor space was
taken up with merchandise, too. After the customers had left
the store, the storekeeper was asked if he did not fear that his
goods would be taken while he was at the rear of the building.
"If I had turned around while walking from the front to the
rear of the store," he explained, "something would have been
missing, for I would have offended their sense of honesty, but by
giving no sign of suspicion&mdash;trusting them&mdash;had I remained
away an hour everything in the place would be, on my return,
as it was when I went away."</p>

<p>Samoans are a religious race. On Sundays the streets are
crowded with natives dressed in highly-colored lava-lavas, each
carrying a Bible and hymn book. They are good singers.</p>

<p>Only a few miles from Apia, Robert Louis Stevenson, the
novelist, lived and died. On Mount Vaca, rising a thousand
feet above Apia, his remains lie, and a portion of the tomb may
be seen through the thick foliage when sailing into the harbor.
His home, "Vailima," is now the residence of the Governor-General.</p>

<p>"Talofa" is the passing salute in Samoa, which, translated,
is "My love to you." "Tofa" is the parting word on leaving
a Samoan home, meaning "good-by."</p>

<p>Foreign labor is imported to work on plantations, as the
natives cannot be depended upon; Chinamen are generally employed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
And what an improvement the Chinaman is on the
Indian coolie!</p>

<p>The Samoan is a fatalist. If the idea comes into his head
that he is going to die no power on earth will keep him alive.
He gives right up, lies down on the ground, in a boat, or
wherever he may be&mdash;just makes up his mind that his time has
come.</p>

<p>A Samoan chief dressed in war regalia is an object of interest.
His well shaped head, covered with a heavy growth of
black hair brushed back and glossy from applications of cocoanut
oil, rests on a stocky neck. The face is round, complexion
bronze, and he generally wears a mustache. In addition to a
necklace, thickly studded with polished, round, sharp-pointed
pieces of bone, several inches in length, which encircles the neck,
a loop of stout cord, ornamented with larger and rougher pieces
of bone, resting on the shoulders and extending to below the
chest, is worn. Save for the necklace and loop, the warrior is
bare to his waist. From waistline to between knee and ankle
he is covered with a bulky kilt&mdash;often made of bark cloth&mdash;this
being embellished with fringe, tassels and ribbon woven
from tropical fibers. Plump, but not fat, he stands about 5
feet 6 inches. A rifle is a fighting feature of the chief's equipment,
and, like most Samoans, is in bare feet.</p>

<p>Elephantiasis makes its appearance in Samoa, and natives
with legs swollen to the proportion of an elephant's may be
seen walking any time at a slow, shuffling gait, about the islands.
This disease occurs more often in tropical sea sections, and is
believed to be caused by a blood parasite. The legs become
enormously enlarged, due to inflammation of the skin and obstructed
circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>America has adopted a good system of looking after natives'
copra produced on the islands of Manua and Tutuila, United
States territory. An officer in charge at Pago-Pago receives the
goods, weighs it, gives a receipt for the product, and sells when
the market offers the best price. In the meantime, if the native
needs money, he can, by applying to the proper officer, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
funds advanced to him. When his copra is sold, he is paid the
full price.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo246" id="illo246"></a>
<img src="images/illo246.jpg" width="550" height="344" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Interior of Samoan Home, Built of Breadfruit Tree, Secured by Coir; No Nails Used.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Samoa.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The huts or homes of the Samoans, circular in form, are the
best built of those of any native races. From a heavy center
upright beam, 12 to 16 feet in length, scantlings extend to a
circular support, which rests on posts three feet high. The roof,
composed of cocoanut palm leaves, is secured to breadfruit wood
scantlings. Palm-leaf curtains, the width of the space from
post to post, are attached to the circular timber. During the
day the shades are raised all round, allowing air to pass through,
and at night they are lowered. As an additional means of
cooling the home, a strip of pebbles, two feet wide, extends
around the hut, mats covering the floor space each side of the
circle of small stones. The bed is composed of half a dozen
to a dozen cocoanut-leaf mats, four feet wide and six feet in
length, and white cotton sheets, laid on the floor. In the morning
the bedding is rolled together, placed on poles above, and
taken down at bedtime. As chairs do not figure in the furnishing
of a Samoan home, a leaf mat is used as a seat.</p>

<p>Though Samoans will not unload ships, they have no objection
to washing clothes. They board vessels in the harbor and
solicit laundry work, charging eight cents apiece. For a white
suit of drill they charge only eight cents, a pair of socks or a
collar costing the same.</p>

<p>On a sailing ship, and on a naval cutter plying between Pago-Pago
and Apia (both seen here), also on a schooner at Dunedin,
N. Z., were the only instances since leaving New York when
the Stars and Stripes was observed flying from vessels.</p>

<p>Upolu Island, on which Apia is located, is second in area
to Savaii, being 38 miles long and 12 wide. Samoa is one
place in the Southern Pacific Ocean that Abel Tasman was
not the first to set eyes on, this group being discovered by Captain
Roggeville, in 1721.</p>

<p>We reached Apia on a Sydney Sunday (Eastern time), which
was Saturday in Apia (Western time). Naturally, Sydney's
Monday was Apia's Sunday, so we had two Saturdays and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
two Sundays that week. It is difficult for the layman to understand
how twelve hours can make a day, as we appeared to
lose one after crossing the line of the 180th meridian from east
to west.</p>

<p>A weekly newspaper of 48 columns, 25 of these advertisements,
is published in Apia. Only 200 Europeans live in the
town, yet a newspaper of that size appears to flourish.</p>

<p>The American consul called at the ship one evening in tropical
evening dress to have a chat with the American passengers&mdash;four
in number. He asked the captain of the vessel, who was
a Britisher, to blow his whistle three times on sailing out of
the harbor, when he would acknowledge the salute by lowering
the flag on the staff at the consulate. The captain kept his
word, the following day, but the flag did not move. There is
nothing strange about such forgetfulness, however, for the consulate
is located in "The Land of Delicious Idleness."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>We will now say "Tofa" to that splendid race and their
pretty islands and make a start for Tonga, when the day
"lost" will be reclaimed, as we recross the 180th meridian.
The captain did not turn back the ship's clock here, but kept
the Sydney time.</p>

<p>Passing between two prominent stone walls, we entered the
harbor of Vavau, Tonga, another group of the South Sea Islands.
This group appears on some maps as the Friendly
Islands. Abel Tasman, who discovered so many countries before
any one else, but allowed others to claim what he first saw,
discovered the Tongan group in 1643. Over a hundred years
later Captain James Cook, the explorer, made three visits to
these islands, before and after he had planted the British flag
on Australia and New Zealand. The Tongans have always
had self-government, but the group is under the protection of
the British. The native ruling power is King George Tubou
II. Parliament consists of 32 elected representatives and an
equal number of hereditary chiefs, all of native birth. The
islands also boast a Prime Minister, a Chancellor of the Exchequer,
a Chief Justice and other high officials.</p>

<p>King George Tubou II., at the opening of Parliament,
wears a European court suit, a gold and jeweled crown, and
a long mantle of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine, which
is supported by two boys attired in tights, trunks, and feathered
caps, while the king's soldiers line the highway along which
the royal procession marches. To maintain that standard of
royalty the natives are taxed $10 each a year, with maturity
age at 16. The native head tax in Fiji is $5, and in Samoa $3,
so the Tongan pays highly for the royal atmosphere he breathes.</p>

<p>The harbor of Vavau is the prettiest we have seen, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
would not be advisable to make that statement in Sydney, Australia.
While the striking panorama offered by Sydney's is
absent here, Nature's lavish tropical adornment offsets that feature,
wrought mainly by the hand of man, in the former. For
seven miles, from the imposing Heads to the small town at the
other end, the shores are studded with cocoanut palms, and the
bay is beautifully bedecked with small and pretty islands, thickly
verdured with a moistened growth, the fronds of the cocoanut
palm and leaves of the banana bush growing on these dipping
their points into the still, mirror-like blue water from every
side. Smaller vegetation grows upward for a time, but later
yields to the seductiveness of the clear, calm, coral-reflected
water, when the bright, tender tips of these become fondled, as
it were, by the gentle ripples, adding more attractiveness to
this unusual scene of natural beauty. These islands would remind
one of a flower-pot overgrown with drooping ferns. The
vessel is pointed straight, then veers, when the foliage of one
of these green barriers seems almost to brush the water-line of
the ship. After a turn in another direction, the course is
straight again for a short distance. Another of these pretty
islands is seen just ahead, when the vessel slants and seem to
barely miss caressing the foliage drooping into the water. All
the while the palm-studded shore maintains its most pronounced
beauty. Traveling through Vavau harbor is like sailing
through an enchanted botanical garden.</p>

<p>"Malolelei," the word a visitor first hears from a Tongan,
is "Good day" in the native language. One soon asks another
who knows how to pronounce the word to teach him the vernacular,
for the salute is supposed to be returned. Every one
says "Malolelei."</p>

<p>The Tongan is very friendly to the whites, which explains
how the name "Friendly Islands" came to be applied to the
Tongan group. Mariners, in early days, when shipwrecked on
the shores of these islands, were killed, cut up, and made stew
of. But nowadays they would be fed, housed and receive any
and every attention that would make their misfortune easier
to bear. Were a white man known to be in need, every native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
would feel it his duty to help relieve him. Each would bring
with him food, and if the hungry man could eat all that was
brought to him he might live to be as old as Methuselah without
worrying about money to pay his board bill.</p>

<p>"The Sun is dead!" was the term used by the natives to
describe a total eclipse of the sun that took place while traveling
through the South Sea section of the journey. The words were
spoken in a solemn tone, and it was amusing to note the difference
in their voices and faces when, the eclipse being over, they
shouted, "The Sun is alive again!"</p>

<p>Little of interest is to be seen at Vavau, as only 60 white
persons live here, most of them traders. Native meat is scarce,
as practically no grain or potatoes grow in tropical countries,
so European food staples have to be imported to the islands of
the South Seas. As an offset for these importations, bananas,
copra and pineapples are exported to either Auckland or Sydney.</p>

<p>"Good-by to chops and juicy steaks&mdash;canned meat for you
henceforth"&mdash;were the parting words an Australian received
who left the ship at a Tongan port. He had decided
to make his home in Tonga, and no person would feel the loss
of a mutton chop more keenly than an Australian.</p>

<p>We again sail through Vavau's botanical harbor, and next
stop at Haapai, a port on another island of the group. Traveling
from South Sea ports, the deck of a ship is crowded with
natives, whose bodies shine with cocoanut oil, and all have
cocoanut palm leaf baskets and banana-leaf plates. Sometimes
a piece of purple-colored taro is bitten off and eaten, or a dozen
cocoanuts are tilted and natives drink the liquid; then a whole
orange may be forced inside the mouth, when a series of prying
with the fingers takes place, causing contortions of the face, in
the effort to squeeze out the juice, when the caved-in orange
will be withdrawn and thrown away. All are bareheaded,
wearing vari-colored kilts and waists, and everybody happy and
seemingly well fed. A feature of the Tongan's "luggage" is
the great quantity of food each brings with him. They have
good faces, but are not up to the general appearance of the
Samoan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>The shore on which the little town of Haapai is built is a
picture. Lined with an unbroken row of cocoanut palms, as
far as one could see over the tops of these there was no other
growth. Coral reefs are very pretty here, and tiny bright blue
fish dart like butterflies from caves in the reefs and in turquoise-blue
pools. At some places the bottom of the sea is like a
garden, as growing therefrom is peculiar colored seaweed,
striped and spotted shells being numerous.</p>

<p>Tonga homes cannot compare with those of Samoa. They
are hayrick shaped, seldom have a window, and two doors generally
lead to the inside. The floors are covered with cocoanut-leaf
mats, and the beds are of mats of the same material. A
lantern is used to light their huts at night; the oil burned in
these comes from the United States. A big circular wooden
bowl, with legs cut from the heart of a large tree, used to mix
the native drink in, is another important utensil in the Tongan
home; the bottom is of a slaty-blue color. Cocoanut-shell cups
figure prominently in native utensils. Some Tongans, however,
live in frame houses, roofed with iron.</p>

<p>A native drink, known as kava, is universally used throughout
the islands of the South Pacific Ocean. The drink is made
from the root of a shrub, which is sometimes pounded into small
pieces with stones, but of late years graters have been used; and
coffee-grinders serve the purpose still better. Gratings from
the root are placed in the wooden bowl, and water is poured on
these. The coarser grounds are strained from the kava by grass
or fibers from the bark of certain shrubs or trees. A European
would have to acquire a liking for this native drink, as at first
it tastes like a mixture of soapsuds and ginger. When drunk
to excess it does not affect the head, but the legs become paralyzed
for a few hours; blindness also follows its abuse. Kava
is served in cocoanut cups.</p>

<p>Tongans number but 21,000, and all belong to some religious
denomination. Church collections are taken only once a year.
The "basket" is never passed for contributions. A wooden
bowl or a galvanized kettle is placed under the pulpit, and each
goes forward and puts his contribution in the "box." A majority,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
18,000 out of the 21,000, are identified with the
Wesleyan Church, and this number contributes the sum of $25,000
a year. They build their own churches and give their
services free. Few nails are used in these buildings, the timbers
being secured by coir, or cinnet. If the wood be dark, the
brown fibers of the cocoanut are dyed the color of the wood
that is to be lashed. The cinnet lashing seen in the church
buildings is splendidly done, and often resembles carving. The
Tongans hold their churches in much reverence. At some frame
houses in the towns is seen a round galvanized tank to hold
rain water running from the roof. However, they consider it
sacrilege to conserve the water running from the roof of a
church.</p>

<p>A traveling acquaintance who had lived in Tonga for years
was asked if white people locked their doors at night. "Yes,"
he replied, "the kitchen door&mdash;to keep the cats out."</p>

<p>Poverty is unknown here, as are jails. Each Tongan has
8¼ acres of land, and the copra from that area not only furnishes
sufficient money to buy what is needed but allows a
small surplus besides.</p>

<p>Not one murder has taken place in the group in over 20
years, and then a white man was mixed up in it. This will
seem more remarkable when it is remembered that almost every
native carries a big knife, with which to shuck cocoanuts and
cut the stems of bananas. But two races live in Tonga&mdash;300
whites and the balance Tongans.</p>

<p>One hundred islands compose this group, Tongatabu, on
which the capital is built, being the largest and most important.
That island is 20 miles long and 12 miles wide.</p>

<p>Nukualofa, the capital, our next stop, is 1,100 miles from
Auckland, New Zealand. Europeans there do not exceed 75
persons, but the native population is comparatively large. The
King's palace and the Chapel Royal are the most conspicuous
buildings in the town. A royal guard, consisting of half a
dozen brown-skinned soldiers, dressed in scarlet coats, see that
their king nor his property are molested. The king is a man of
striking appearance, six feet four inches in height, very stout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and in the forties. The line of succession in Tonga passes
through the mother, not the father. King George Tubou
II.'s salary is $10,000 a year. The Tonga group is the only
independent kingdom now left in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Grass grows everywhere in Nukualofa, including the streets.
A buggy, drawn by a small, woolly horse, may pass half a
dozen times a day along the main streets, or a native on horseback,
with a flaring-colored shirt, may create a little temporary
excitement occasionally dashing along a thoroughfare as fast
as the horse's legs can carry him. Children do not appear to
quarrel, roosters seemed to be imbued with the spirit of peace,
and the weather is generally too hot for dogs to have a fall
out; so one going to Nukualofa with distracted nerves is apt to
feel stronger after a stay in the Tongan capital. To borrow
from Samoa, it is another "land of delicious idleness."</p>

<p>It is in places of this character where one comes across British
ne'er-do-wells, or "remittance men," as they are termed.
These are sent from Great Britain by wealthy parents to isolated
places like Tonga and Fiji, and a certain sum of money is
sent them each month&mdash;enough to pay their board and a little
over for spending money. They are too far away to disgrace
the family, and it is cheaper to pay their expenses in far-off
countries than it would be to support them at home. They are
virtually prisoners in these out-of-the-way places, for they soon
get in debt, and no one owing money can leave the islands.
These men generally marry a native woman, drink all the
whisky and soda they can get, and the wife's income from her
cocoanut farm provides for the home.</p>

<p>Consumption is making inroads among this splendid race of
natives. Some discard their native clothes and wear European
apparel; they then live in a house instead of a hut, which is unnatural;
but, worst of all, they cease to rub themselves with
cocoanut oil, and in other ways neglect the customs of their
ancestors. The native mode of living is much the better for
the native. European customs do not seem to agree with colored
races. It is the same with all native races&mdash;when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
come in contact with the white man they generally go down
hill.</p>

<p>Some of the prettiest trees in the world are to be seen in
Nukualofa. They do not grow high, but their spread is so
wide and the outlines of the limbs so regular that one never
forgets them.</p>

<p>Flying foxes&mdash;large bats, or vampires&mdash;are sacred animals
to the Tongan. Some distance from Nukualofa is a grove of
large trees, and in the daytime thousands of the bats will be
hanging from the limbs by their claws, heads down. At sunset
they all wake up and fly over the island and make raids on fruit
plantations. At sunrise they will return to the same grove
and hang downward all day. These bats are as large as cats,
with furry bodies, and the native believes something terrible
would happen were he to kill one.</p>

<p>Tongans are more advanced, intellectually, than any of the
South Sea races, not excepting the Maori, who is of the same
race. A college in Nukualofa is well attended by natives.</p>

<p>Kaikai is the name of food in the South Sea Islands, as it is
also in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Tongan women do not work like those of other South Sea
Islands races. The men say it makes women ugly to work all
day in the sun, and they prefer their wives to be good-looking
and good-natured. Men even do the larger share of the housework.</p>

<p>White drill clothes are worn by all Europeans in Tonga,
and every man has a tropical evening dress suit. The suit
shows a wide spread of white shirt, generally starched, and
high collar. Vests and trousers are white. The coat is a
jacket, however, that stops a trifle below the waist line. At the
back the jacket comes to a point. It is like a ship steward's
jacket.</p>

<p>"Teddy Bears" are as universal as American oil and American
sewing-machines. In any part of the world one may observe
European children with "Teddies" in their hands.</p>

<p>Europeans living in the tropics become so enervated that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
such a thing as failing to keep an appointment is thought nothing
of. The blood becomes thin, and the easy life they live
practically unfits them for work they would be called on to do
in a cooler climate. Then, again, they are looked up to in the
sparsely settled white communities, and when they return to
the Northland and practically become nonentities they painfully
miss the pampering they received from natives. Most of
these would prefer to live a sickly life in the tropics to a
healthful one, contingent on hard work, in their native land.
It is hard to rise above the pressure of environment.</p>

<p>We are about to start on Leg Five, but before doing so we
wish to explain our divergence of travel in Australasia. On
reaching Melbourne from Perth a day's time was all that was
spent in the city at that time. We went to Tasmania, New
Zealand, and then to Sydney. From New South Wales we
started on the South Sea Islands trip. From Nukualofa we
journeyed to Auckland, our second time in that city. Recrossing
the Tasman Sea to Sydney, we journeyed to Melbourne
by rail, the second time also we were in that city. Stopping
there but a few hours, a start was made for Adelaide; then
from Adelaide to Ballarat, and back to Melbourne, where some
time was spent, from which port we sailed on our return trip
to South Africa, and from which place we start Leg Five.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time in my travels I had to be content with
third-class steamship accommodation. I knew the South Sea
Islands trip would shrivel my pocketbook, and would not have
been disappointed had I not enough money to buy even a third-class
ticket to South Africa. We took a chance on the South
Sea Islands trip&mdash;and won. "Steerage," in big red type, was
stamped on the steamship ticket that carried me from Melbourne
to South Africa, but all passengers were on an equality,
as there was but one grade of accommodation&mdash;third.</p>

<p>Supper was the first meal on board, but no tea or coffee was
served. The absence of these "luxuries" was explained later,
passengers being informed that tea or coffee was provided only
once daily&mdash;at breakfast time. At the first morning meal a
hubbub took place among mothers with babes. Something was
wrong with the milk, and when that matter had also been explained
we learned that sea water&mdash;salt water&mdash;had been
used, instead of fresh water, to dilute the condensed milk.</p>

<p>The cabins contained from two to ten berths, and as almost
every one prefers privacy a few dollars more were paid for a
two-berth cabin, as little sleep could be anticipated were interests
pooled with nine snoring mates. The two-berth cabin
had no margin to boast of, as, in order for one to get a handkerchief
from his hip pocket, it was necessary to vacate it and
seek arm-turning space in the hallway. I had a good cabin
mate, and we soon came to an understanding as to what time
each of us would visit our quarters. Two could sleep in the
cabin, but there was not room enough for two to turn in it.
The pillow&mdash;we would not be so rash as to say the slip covered
a chunk of cement; it may have been tan bark. The door
had no lock, neither was there a button to ring up the steward.</p>

<p>The ship stopped at Hobart, took on 30,000 cases of apples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and headed for Albany, West Australia. The tea merchants in
the Tasmania capital did a good business for the time being,
as passengers who, before starting, knew nothing of the rules
of the ship concerning tea and coffee allowances laid in here a
good supply, together with preserves, crackers, Chinese napkins
and other necessities the ship did not furnish.</p>

<p>Ninety dollars for eight weeks' travel is surely giving passengers
a cheap journey. The vessel sailed from Sydney the
first week in June, reaching her destination, London, England,
about the first of August, after a voyage of 14,000 miles. Three
hundred persons had booked passage on the liner, and of that
number there was not one foreign-speaking passenger aboard.
This will seem strange when it is borne in mind that the most
cosmopolitan place in the world is a passenger steamship. Seven
preachers were included, which, sea tradition says, generally
augurs for bad weather; but, as there are exceptions to almost
every rule, we had smooth sailing after clearing the Bight and
Cape Leeuwin. The "animal" classification of the cargo included
birds&mdash;canaries, magpies, parrots and cockatoos; also
a joey, as a young kangaroo is called. This animal was bought
at Albany by an American, the tariff on the joey to London
being $10. The freight charge for a canary was 60 cents, and
rates for larger birds were from 75 cents to $1.25.</p>

<p>Fruit&mdash;generally confined to apples or oranges&mdash;was served
at supper. The apples often seemed nearly as hard as billiard
balls and as tasteless as frozen turnips. A prosperous Irishman,
of a ripe age, who had gone to Australia in early days, when
six months' time was required to make the voyage, was, with
his aged wife, returning to the Emerald Isle. One evening,
when we had oranges for supper, after he had bitten into one,
the Celt was observed going through a series of facial contortions,
with shoulder movements&mdash;something after the fashion
of an agitated Frenchman. "Are the oranges sweet to-night,
Mr. O'Gorman?" he was asked. "Sweet?" whipped back the
old Roman, as water dripped from the tear-ducts of his eyes
and fire snapped from the corners&mdash;"Sweet? They're so
sharup they'd cut your t'roat!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>Cake was served Sunday afternoons, and milk, sugar and hot
water were at the pleasure of passengers, but they had to furnish
their own tea or coffee. The tea and teapot, for instance,
would be given to the table steward, and he would make the
tea and serve it at mealtime. A piano added greatly to the entertainment
of the passengers, as concerts were held twice a
week. Besides, various athletic sports were indulged in.</p>

<p>The preachers took turns officiating at Sunday services. As
there were seven of them&mdash;the voyage embracing as many
Sabbaths&mdash;each one had an opportunity to keep in practice.
One of their number, a Scotch Presbyterian, was on his way
from Australia to his native country for a "holiday." Except
at mealtime, he could generally be found sitting in a corner of
the smoking saloon burning up black cigars, as he was a confirmed
smoker; he was also a devotee of, and an expert at, the
game of checkers, or draughts, as that amusement is termed
in British territory. While no one on the ship had a chance to
beat him, during the course of a game he would buoy, from
time to time, the hope entertained by a presumptuous rival of
lowering the parson's colors with clerical flattery&mdash;pretending
that his opponent had nearly caught him napping on certain
moves and that the skill of the player was worthy any foeman's
steel. An Irish Presbyterian also was among the clergymen,
and he sometimes sat at a table for hours with another passenger,
in tomb-like stillness&mdash;playing a game of chess. Chess
players, as a rule, have a poor opinion of checkers&mdash;calling it
a child's game. The Irish dominie was asked if much skill was
required to play checkers. "No," was the reply. "Any one
can learn that game in a week." A short time later, when the
Scotch preacher was engaged at checkers, and won, as usual, he
congratulated his opponent on the splendid game he had played.
"There's a great deal of superfluous talk about checkers&mdash;one
would think that only persons of superior intellect could play
that game," remarked a passenger to the Scotchman. A sneer
came over the preacher's face. "I've been playing draughts
for 30 years and don't know the game yet," he tartly answered.
"Why," returned the passenger, "a man on this ship said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
there was nothing to it&mdash;that any one could learn the game
in a week." "Who's the man that said he could learn the
game of draughts in a week!" he exclaimed, in eloquent tones.
"Who's the man! Point him out!" He lost control of a
strong cigar, and every one laughed but the padre.</p>

<p>Durban was reached 26 days after leaving Melbourne, and
here I found myself left with only $2 of the $750 with which I
started for the Antipodes. (Reference to the last paragraph of
Leg Two and the Itinerary printed at the end of the book will
explain conditions.)</p>

<p>On a German ship we took final leave of Durban and South
Africa, the route being along what is known as the East Coast
of Africa and across the western end of the Indian Ocean, to
Bombay, India. Every berth was engaged. New scenes ahead
bespoke an interesting voyage. America was well represented
among the passengers, as there were eight&mdash;five missionaries,
two theatrical men and a printer.</p>

<p>A day's sail along the flat coast of Zululand and Tongaland
and southern Portuguese-East Africa found us in Lourenzo
Marques, the capital of Portuguese-East Africa. Seldom is the
name Lourenzo Marques heard in this part of the world.
"Delagoa Bay" is used 99 times out of 100 when speaking of
that East Coast capital. Mention was made in the few Lisbon
notes of the white and gray paving used in that city, and the
same kind of pavement in Lourenzo Marques brings one's mind
back to the Portuguese capital, particularly "Rolling Motion
Square." The white population of Portuguese-East Africa is
small considering the large territory embraced in that colony,
Europeans numbering only 3,000. Public buildings do not
make much of a showing, a good harbor and docks being the
city's chief assets. Street car and electric light systems, a seaside
resort and high prices are some of the characteristics of
Lourenzo Marques. Natives are very numerous, and African
fever&mdash;a notorious feature of this place&mdash;is so prevalent that
all the white residents have a veiny, sickly appearance.</p>

<p>Fever trees, so called from their sallow appearance, grow not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
far from here. The leaves droop, are small, thin and lifeless,
while the bark on the stunted trunks and limbs is scaly.</p>

<p>Lourenzo Marques, located on Delagoa Bay, is the nearest
port for the Transvaal, through which most of the machinery
and supplies for the great mines passed until the consolidation
of the South African provinces. It was, in short, the chief
Boer port of South Africa. Were the deaths that occurred
while building the railroad from here to Pretoria made public
it would make sad reading. During the stretch of 400 miles
separating Johannesburg and Lourenzo Marques some of the
territory traversed is through the worst fever zones in the
world&mdash;even the trees contracting "fever."</p>

<p>Cruising along to the next port, Inhambane&mdash;also Portuguese
territory&mdash;where the stately cocoanut palm raises its
bushy head to an admiring distance from the earth, we again
reach the tropics. Four of the missionaries disembarked&mdash;a
bishop and his wife, and one other couple, who were located
at a mission station a short distance from this port.</p>

<p>Three hundred whites live in this treacherous place and 30
per cent. die each year. The permanent missionary and his
wife had both been fever victims, and if they fail soon to get
out of the Inhambane district they will never come out alive.
The husband is a powerfully built man, and his wife's skin as
fair as a lily. She would be called pretty. They both had a
good education, and both were hard workers. The missionary's
predecessor had become "salted," but the bodies of three
wives were resting under African soil. Black-water fever is
nearly always certain death. Until a few years ago death was
as certain after having contracted that form of fever as to one
who stepped in front of a locomotive traveling at a speed of a
mile a minute. All liquids drunk by a victim turn black.</p>

<p>A native was induced to scale a cocoanut tree and knock
nuts off. Eight tumbled down, and we were charged two cents
each for them. The cocoanut tree has no season&mdash;it blossoms
and bears the year round.</p>

<p>Native women loaded and unloaded the ship, and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
stronger than the men. Sugar, copra and peanuts were put on
at that port.</p>

<p>The anchor chain winds round the drum, and off we start
on another run, bringing us to Beira, also in Portuguese territory,
the port for Rhodesia. The best route to reach Salisbury
or Bulawayo is from Beira. To the former place it is some
300 miles, and to Bulawayo nearly 700 miles.</p>

<p>Venice, Italy, is unique in canals and in the absence of
vehicular traffic; and Beira may claim some resemblance to the
Italian city, notably in the absence of carriages, automobiles,
wagons, motorcycles and street cars. Beira is built on a sandbar,
and the means of travel in that place is by vehicles called
"trolleys," four-wheeled conveyances. The frame is of iron,
and a foot-rest, seat, back and hood are built on this. It is a
small carriage on low wheels. The track on which the trolley
runs is two feet wide, and the rails are one-inch thick. Ties or
sleepers support these. The "power" to move the "trolley"
is two natives, who push the vehicle, and push it on the run.
These natives are dressed in white cotton shirts, with short
sleeves, and with a lava-lava or kilt made of calico, with big
spots, which reaches to the knees. Their hat is a red fez with
tassels, which suggests we have reached the influence of the
Arab. The "trolley" pusher never runs between the rails&mdash;always
on the one-inch rail. One would think there are grooves
in his feet to fit in these. The streets are intersected by
"trolley" tracks, switches being made at places, where
"trolleys" branch to certain streets. On the main street are
three tracks, and turntables have been built here and there on
which to turn the cars around when ready for the return trip.
They are comfortable to ride in, and most of them are privately
owned.</p>

<p>With the exception of a good sea wall, there is little of the
substantial about Beira&mdash;only a few frame buildings, and
others of corrugated iron. Arab merchants are numerous, and
where they have become established there is very little money
for the white man, few modern customs being in evidence.</p>

<p>One of my cabin mates was a Trappist priest. Born in Ohio,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
he went to Africa in his early years, and had been teaching
natives for a quarter of a century. He was a chaplain in the
Boer War, and his intimate knowledge of that interesting country
was so general as to break set rules for bedtime when listening
to his experiences.</p>

<p>The ship's whistle blows and we are off again, traveling
through what is known as the Mozambique Channel, that
stretch of water separating Madagascar, a French possession,
from Portuguese-East Africa. The latter country is 750 miles
in length and 200 miles wide. The seashore all along is as
free of ruggedness as the shores of a lake located in a level
plain.</p>

<p>Negro melodies and popular airs were reeled off their musical
instruments by the two Americans at intervals of a few nights
between. We had a congenial lot of passengers, and every one
was enjoying the voyage.</p>

<p>Three more stops were made in Portuguese-East Africa, but
no enterprise was apparent. Few white people were to be
seen, while Indians, Arabs and natives were as thick as flies.
At Ibo, the last stop, the cargo was brought from shore to the
ship in what are called dhows, with ragged sails, scaly hulks,
chipped masts, frazzled ropes&mdash;the sort of vessels that have
been used in Asia for 2,000 years. Rubber trees grow in that
section and, together with copra, comprise the exports.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>Dar-es-Salaam, the capital of German-East Africa, was,
after leaving Ibo, the next place where the vessel put in. What
a difference is observable in the make-up and general appearance
of this German town to those in Portuguese-East Africa! Some
very imposing stone and cement buildings, with others under
construction; good streets, clean surroundings, and a sprinkling
of white people, were a very welcome change from the poorly
built and almost totally black-populated places we had left
behind.</p>

<p>The railway station, freight cars and locomotives, good
wharves and paved streets brought to mind old scenes. For
nearly 800 miles the railroad pierces westward through a black-populated
and wild-beast inhabited country to the shore of
Lake Tanganyika, this body of water, 420 miles long and 10
to 60 miles wide, being the boundary of this German possession
and the Belgian Congo. Rubber and coffee plantations have
been laid out, particularly at the western end of the railroad
line; and from the great native passenger traffic, and bringing
of supplies to these and to races far beyond the western terminus,
good returns are assured. The area of this German possession
is 384,000 square miles.</p>

<p>Unlike Beira, motor cars and bicycles were in evidence in
Dar-es-Salaam, but no horses were to be seen, as in Beira. In
the South African notes mention was made of the miserable
breed of horse in Durban, also of horses being unable to live
in some parts of that country. So, on the East Coast of Africa,
where horses cannot live, and the life of Europeans is measured
by but a short number of years, there must be something radically
wrong with the climate.</p>

<p>Numerous fresh earth mounds may be seen in graveyards in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the settlements along the East Coast. Fat men are scarce in
these districts, all having a slender frame and veiny, bleached
appearance, with drooping eyelids. Malarial and black-water
fever are prevalent in Dar-es-Salaam. White clothes, white
cloth or skin shoes, and white helmets are worn. This place has
a European population of 1,000, most of them government employes.
The native population is 25,000.</p>

<p>Natives build their own huts, which are of mud, covered
with cocoanut leaves, and settlements are located some distance
from town.</p>

<p>The sight of native women prisoners, with a band of iron
around the neck and a chain fastened to the first band, then to
the second, and so on, according to the number of prisoners,
seemed pretty severe punishment&mdash;too barbarous even for
blacks. This is what we saw in Dar-es-Salaam. Six or eight
men and women are generally chained together. The steel
collar or band, an inch and a half wide, opens and closes with
a clasp, and the length of the chain from band to band is between
two and three feet. Groups of women were seen carrying
water on their heads in five-gallon oil-cans. The prisoners
have to move at the same time, as the chain is connected
with the iron band around each neck. The band and chain is
a relic of slavery days, as we are at a noted slave-trading
center.</p>

<p>This German capital is the prettiest town on the East Coast
of Africa. It is smart in appearance, has an electric light plant
and good drives. Cocoanut palms grow all around, and the
fragrance from the frangi-pangi flower heavily perfumes the
atmosphere and adds much to the attractiveness of that center.
Germany acquired this possession in 1886.</p>

<p>"Should you wear your street dress ashore, instead of the
short skirt, it may 'let the cat out of the bag,' and then we
would have to pay the full fare," one of our lady passengers
cautioned her daughter who wished to join other travelers
making ready to leave the ship to take a look at the German
colony capital. Mother and daughter embarked at Lourenzo
Marques, having come from the Transvaal, their destination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
being Bombay, India. The daughter, twenty, being slightly
under medium size, did not look her age. When booking their
passage she was represented as "fifteen," any one of that age
or under being carried for half rate. Short skirts, extending to
just below the knees, were worn as an age "decoy" to this
point of the journey. Though Miss Agnes bravely nursed her
sheepishness, evoked by wearing "kid clothes" as she termed
the "disguise," aboard ship, she drew the line at appearing "in
public" in them. The captain having been observed leaving
the vessel in his launch, Agnes, learning of this, hurriedly
donned a "woman's" dress, joined the sightseeing party ashore,
and took the chance of being detected. Returning to the ship
before the skipper, she quickly changed street clothes to the
"kid" garb, breaking her suspense, none of the officers being
any the wiser, and resumed the journey to Bombay, as she
started from the Portuguese port&mdash;a combination of woman-juvenile-half-fare
passenger.</p>

<p>Zanzibar, on Zanzibar Island, is located 40 miles from Dar-es-Salaam.
All the way from Durban we had been getting
breaths of Asia, but Zanzibar is like an Asia in Africa. With
perhaps the exception of Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, Zanzibar
is the largest place on the African continent. Out of a
mixed population, composed of Arabs, Mohammedans, Hindus,
Singhalese, Goanese, Parsis and natives&mdash;negroes&mdash;only 500
are whites. Though the city was inhabited as early as the tenth
century, their first sultan did not begin to reign until 1741.</p>

<p>Mohammedan women&mdash;on whose features no one but husband
or family are permitted to set eyes&mdash;walking about with
their faces covered in a cloth having eye-holes cut out; palanquins,
enclosed boxes accommodating one person, are carried by
two natives, one on each end of a pole, on which the box rests,
these containing the wives of Arabs and Mohammedans; native
women, ever ready to imitate the clothing of others, are seen
entirely covered in black cloth, save for the eye-holes in their
face coverings; these dark, mysterious, and weird creatures
stalk about the alleyways of Zanzibar during the day and the
night hours. The pale face of the Parsi woman, the Hindu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
woman with ornaments in her nostrils, on her ears, arms, hands
and toes, and the gewgaws worn by native women, are seen at
every turn. The Parsi, with his cuff-like cap; the Singhalese
with his long, oily hair and amber haircomb; the Hindu, in
his big, cloth head-covering; the bewhiskered Arab, wearing a
fez, and the black, woolly bare head of the native, form an unusual
scene on entering the city of Zanzibar. The Waswahili
are the natives, and the native language of the island, German-East
Africa, and British-East Africa is the Kiswahili.</p>

<p>Zanzibar, comprising the island of Pemba, 40 miles to the
north, is a British possession. The island of Zanzibar is 50
miles in length and 20 miles wide. These islands are presided
over by a Sultan, Seyid Khalifa bin Harub, but his ruling has to
be approved by a British governor-general. He is sultan in
name only, but his salary is $60,000 a year. The national flag
is of a plain red color. The Sultan received his education in
England.</p>

<p>The streets of the city are so narrow in some instances that
both sides can almost be touched by the hands extended.
Houses are built of brick and cement, and one to three stories in
height. A couple of goats are usually found tied in front of
buildings, and often a donkey may be seen munching a whisk of
grass while standing on the steps of a home. A stranger able
to find his way about Zanzibar must have a pretty level head.
On entering a street, one has no assurance that the street has an
opening, for they often end in a solid building across&mdash;a "blind
alley." Doors to the buildings are heavy enough for a jail, and
the alleys, veiled women, black and suspicious-looking men,
wearing sandals and strange head-coverings, bespeak Asia.
Europeans live in another section.</p>

<p>A very good hospital is pointed out to the visitor, which
indicates in that part of the world a very large graveyard,
Zanzibar being regularly visited with smallpox, while malarial
fever is prevalent and bubonic plague and leprosy common.</p>

<p>Up to 1897 Zanzibar was one of the most noted slave-trading
centers in the world. Slaves shipped from that place
numbered from 6,000 to 10,000 a year. The best building in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the city is the Sultan's palace, but this has recently been converted
into an office building for Protectorate officials; the Sultan's
harem building, located in a city park, is now used as a
place of amusement; but, as Arabs own most of the land, and
also the property in the city, Zanzibar will always remain as
it is.</p>

<p>A distance of seven miles, from the city to Bu-bu-bu, comprises
the railway system of Zanzibar. The fare is 32 cents
first-class and 16 cents second-class, the run taking 45 minutes.
Passing through a street where almost everything is sold&mdash;an
Indian bazaar&mdash;one may reach out of the window of the
railway coach and pull off wearing apparel, shoes, etc., that are
displayed on rope lines outside of the buildings on the narrow
street. Through such places the train seems to be walled in by
blacks on both sides.</p>

<p>The rupee is in use in Zanzibar, along the coast places, and
in the interior in that section of the African continent. The
value of the rupee in American money is 32 cents, and the
anna two cents. The anna piece is nickel, with a hole in the
center, and almost every one carries these on a string. It is
certainly odd to see a man pull from his pocket a string about a
foot or eighteen inches in length and take from it one to half
a dozen annas with bored-out centers.</p>

<p>America was the first country to establish a consulate in
Zanzibar, in 1836. The natives then took a fancy to our
bright-colored calico, which they wear to-day, though close
competition for that trade has taken place through other nations
importing a similar class of goods.</p>

<p>The sun is very hot here, and flowers are temporarily faded
by 10 o'clock in the morning. Should a white person walk a
few feet in the sun bare-headed he would be very apt to fall
from sunstroke.</p>

<p>The date palm, a tree 20 to 30 feet high, with a bare trunk,
as the cocoanut palm, but with smaller limbs and a more spreading
top, grows here. It produces its fruit in bunches, similar
to the banana plant. Some of the clusters of dates depending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
from the top will half fill a barrel. A wide leaf grows from
the stem, to which the dates grow, and in time, the leaf dies
and then bends. It happens, though, that when it bends it
covers and thus protects the large cluster of fruit. Zanzibar
oranges are said to be the sweetest that grow.</p>

<p>One may hear a few taps on a drum at a corner of an alley
in the native quarter any time&mdash;the signal that there will be a
dance that evening.</p>

<p>Automobiles are seen about the city, and an electric light
plant and a wireless station are among the limited public utilities.</p>

<p>Clove and cocoanut plantations are the principal industries
of Zanzibar. The clove tree is of the myrtle family, and the
older it grows the greater the yield. Practically all the cloves
used in the world come from the islands of Pemba and Zanzibar.
There are sent to the United States from these islands
from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 pounds of cloves each year. The
output for a year is from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds. It
requires 10 years' time from planting before the clove tree
blossoms. The Island of Pemba produces 75 per cent. of a
year's crop. A hurricane blew down the trees growing on Zanzibar
island in 1872, while those on Pemba island were not
disturbed. The Pemba trees are 100 years old, those of Zanzibar
island only 50 years old. They are planted 24 feet apart
each way, and 100 grow on an acre.</p>

<p>The clove of commerce is the bud of the clove tree, picked
before the petals open. The clove we use would be the seed
of the clove tree were the petals allowed to expand. The buds
are picked by natives, whose carelessness often destroys bearing
limbs. When picked, the buds are placed on matting, and remain
exposed to the sun for three days, when they become
dried. A clove tree buds for three months, so this is the clove-bud
picking period. The tree grows to a height of 30 feet, is
bushy, with small limbs, on all of which buds grow. The leaf
of the clove tree resembles that of the English poplar. The
buds are more numerous on the limbs at intervals of four and
five years than during the years between. A tree produces from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
five to seven pounds a year, and the price of cloves range from
16 to 20 cents a pound. Growers have to pay a tax to the
government of 25 per cent. of their yield.</p>

<p>When leaving Durban I provided myself with a draft for
$900 on a bank in Bombay, India, and $50 in cash. From the
passengers I heard so many interesting things about British
East Africa that I decided to go inland from Mombasa, if I
could raise the necessary money on the Bombay draft. Taking
my passport for identification, I learned from a banker in
Zanzibar that he could not advance money on the draft, but that
by cancelling the Durban draft and issuing a new one on the
same bank in Bombay he could provide me with any funds
needed. I agreed to that. On receiving the new draft I
learned that $15 had been taken for exchange.</p>

<p>Tanga, German East Africa, a sea junction for that part of
Africa, was our next stop. Passengers going to Europe from
Durban and other points along the East coast trans-ship to the
European liners going through the Suez Canal and Port Said.</p>

<p>A railway from this place pushes westward over 200 miles to
the base of Mount Kilimanjaro, which rises to a height of over
19,000 feet. Tanga is another place that puts one in mind of a
snake charming a bird and then devouring it. Cocoanut palms
grow everywhere, and the pretty trees, frangi-pangi and flowers
are enough to lure any one there. Yet a walk to the graveyard,
after observing the large number of unsodded mounds for a
population of 500, would soon alter one's opinion. The native
population is 12,000.</p>

<p>One of the passengers made up his mind not to shave during
the voyage from Durban to London. The Indian barber is the
most useful tradesman the world over. He carries his kit with
him, and is always prowling about for work. He will shave
a man standing up or lying down; in the rain or in the sun; in
bed or on the roof of a house&mdash;any time, any way, or any
place an Indian barber will do his work. We no sooner stepped
on shore than the unshaven passenger was picked out as a possible
"job," and was shadowed by the black knights of the
razor until he returned to the ship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>Rubber plantations are numerous in this section of the colony,
and copra is another of the exports.</p>

<p>The horse of the East Coast of Africa is really the negro.
Everything is moved on two-wheeled trucks, pushed or pulled
with ropes by natives. No cattle or oxen were seen, so it is
fair to conclude that neither cattle nor horses can live along
this section of the coast. Any one can form an idea of what
a sickly country it must be for human beings where cattle and
horses cannot exist. Fever runs down the natives, also, but not
in the same proportion as the whites.</p>

<p>"The last time we were in Tanga," the ship's doctor remarked
on sailing, "I suffered terribly from jumping toothache.
Fortunate in being in a port where there was a dentist, I
called at his office and had it pulled. Asking him his charge,
the dentist replied, 'Seventy-five rupees' ($25)." When my
eyes again settled in their sockets, having bulged at mention of
such a fee for pulling a tooth, the doctor, in answer to a question
if he did not consider the dentist's charge exorbitant, said
he was under that impression at the time, but was not so sure
of it now. "Only a handful of Europeans live here," he
philosophically went on to explain why he changed his impression
from a positive to an uncertain one, "and fever is
bad. The dentist&mdash;the only one within hundreds of miles&mdash;as
most persons who come to the tropics, aims at making enough
money in a few years, before fever robs him of his health, to
take things easy for a while afterward in a good climate. Life,
with a thumping tooth and a pumpkin-like face, was misery to
me; I could not pull my tooth, and antidotes failed to assuage
the pain it caused. So, considering the fee from various angles,
I would not feel quite justified in charging the dentist with unprofessional
conduct." Notwithstanding the doctor's reconciliation
to the dentist's charge, it would seem he "paid for it
through the nose," to use a British term for "stung," the
standard rate in Africa for placing a tooth in a plate, whether
one or sixteen, being only $5 each.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>Mombasa, British-East Africa, was not reached until 19
days after sailing from Durban, although we traveled but 2,000
miles. It was a very interesting trip, though, along the East
Coast, as the ship stopped so often to unload and take on cargo,
that passengers obtained a fair idea of that part of the world.</p>

<p>Back in the early '80's England and Germany resorted to
every diplomatic device to acquire that great tract of country
now known as German East Africa and British East Africa.
The Sultan of Zanzibar exercised control of a strip of the coastline,
ten miles deep, north of Portuguese East Africa to Italian
Somaliland, which naturally blocked the development of the interior.
The claims of the two great countries were finally
settled by Germany getting the southern part of the domain and
England the northern part. The Sultan of Zanzibar still
claims sovereignty of the ten-mile shore strip of the Indian
Ocean, but in reality it is gone from him. The authentic history
of East Africa commences in 1498, when Vasco da Gama,
the Portuguese explorer, anchored off Mombasa.</p>

<p>Mombasa, located on Mombasa Island, is the chief seaport
on the East Coast north of Durban and Lourenzo Marques.
It has had a checkered career, being held at various times by
Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, Portuguese and British. To-day
the blacks number 30,000 and the whites about 500. Like
most tropical places, the surroundings are naturally attractive,
but fever is always present, and bubonic plague or smallpox may
break out at any moment.</p>

<p>Three years is the limit of residence here for a European.
Some part of the human system is bound to give way if one does
not leave before the three-year period expires. Two and a
half years' residence and six months' vacation in Europe is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
usual custom. The tropical climate seems to center its force on
the muscles of the stomach, and this is one reason why every one
wears flannel bands. Most of the business men are Asiatics.
Natives take the place of horses here also, goods being moved
on trucks pushed and pulled by black men. England's solid
system of doing things is in evidence at every turn&mdash;notably
in the good, clean streets, parks and docks.</p>

<p>Before the railroad was pushed to the eastern shore of Victoria
Nyanza the daring Europeans of early days had to travel
four months before the western terminus was reached. Nowadays
two days' travel by rail will take one into the heart of
Africa. The country then, as it is more or less to-day, was
alive with ferocious beasts, and some of the native tribes were
warlike. During the winter season there is no rain for a
period of from four to six months. Only men of iron would
tackle such a journey. The Arabs, however, had preceded the
whites.</p>

<p>On the Uganda Railway we boarded a train for Nairobi.
For some distance the road passed through a tropical growth,
when we entered the Taru Desert. Small trees of dense and
thorny spreading limbs grow on this land. The lower limbs
are brashy and bare of bark, and the ones above are leafless and
gnarled, although alive. The Taru Desert is a leafless jungle.
No bird life was apparent save vultures, whose repulsive appearance
seemed in keeping with the growth on which they
rested. Fever trees were mentioned earlier in this Leg, and
those growing here suggested the possibility of their exuding
something noxious&mdash;if not odors leading to some form of fever,
then, perhaps, to stomach trouble.</p>

<p>A lone native, and often groups, were seen, with only a
clout about the loins, carrying a long pole with a spear fixed
to the end, at the station or traversing a native path leading
somewhere, as there were no signs of habitation near the railway.
Erect, slender, bareheaded and barefooted, he looked
every inch the savage warrior one reads about.</p>

<p>The track is meter gauge, three feet six inches, and the railway
coaches, of two compartments, are small, each compartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
accommodating six persons, 12 in all. The South African
system&mdash;the best in the world&mdash;of providing free sleeping
berths for passengers, has been adopted by the Uganda Railway
Company. Four berths are provided in each compartment,
but no bedding is furnished. Breakfast costs 32 cents, and
luncheon and dinner 50 cents. Railway fare is only two cents
a mile, and the speed 14 miles an hour.</p>

<p>"Dak bungalow" proved a new building term to us, and
another was the "godown." The dak bungalow serves the purpose
of a hotel and is located at stations. These were built by
the railway company for the convenience of passengers living
in isolated places who used a certain station when traveling.
The bungalow, which may be used one night free of charge, is
provided with spring beds, but no bedding. The godown is a
freight shed&mdash;any building where goods or cargo are stored
is called a godown. Both terms are Asiatic. It would be a
risky undertaking to start through some parts of that country at
night, as many sections are infested with wild beasts. The
agents at the stations were Indians.</p>

<p>We were traveling over a section of country that had not
been refreshed with rain for months. The soil being reddish,
passengers' clothes resembled those worn by workers in a red
brickyard. Conversations that had taken place between travelers
during the voyage along the East Coast, of big game being
seen within easy view of the railway in these parts, which
swayed me from my original route at Zanzibar, were foremost
in my mind at this point. Skeptical of feasting the eye on
herds of zebra, gazelle, wildebeeste, even giraffe, and other
game, my doubts were dispelled when a passenger remarked:</p>

<p>"This is Makindu, where nature's zoo starts." "Do you
think the game will be close enough to see from the train?"
"They're on the veld all the time&mdash;see the zebra to the right?"
he replied. Turning quickly in that direction, there they were,
a solid foreground of striped beasts, not more than half a mile
off the railway. The marvelous sight of thousands of zebra
within easy view extended to the horizon. "You'll always
find zebras huddled closely together," he interestingly went on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
"as they have an eternal fear of lions, who are partial to
zebra flesh," he explained. "The hardest animal in Africa to
tame is the zebra," he continued. "This animal can be ridden,
and is sometimes attached to a light vehicle, but it cannot be
trusted. The fear of lions has for ages been so firmly bred in
the bone of this attractive beast that, no matter how kindly
handled, its wildness is always evident.</p>

<p>"Giraffes are generally seen browsing in the brush," kept on
my companion. "They're sometimes called camelopards,
owing to being spotted like a leopard and having a long neck
like a camel. See!" he exclaimed, pointing, "there's five of
them and a calf." One could scarcely believe his own eyes.
Sure enough, there stood five long-necked, brown and white
spotted, stubby-horned, slant-backed giraffes and a calf, standing
in brush lower than their bodies, 100 feet from the railway
track. As the train was passing they turned around and
ambled clumsily further into the brush.</p>

<p>"All that game you see to the right are hartebeeste and
gazelles," my companion went on. "Keep watching to the
left, though, as we may see more giraffes, for that stretch of
brush will soon be passed, when there'll be no more chance to
see that big game. He's a browser, you know, not a grazer.
There are two more&mdash;a nice pair!" he added. Sure as you're
born, there stood two noble giraffes. Like the group of five
with a calf, they turned and hobbled further into the undergrowth.
"We're about out of the brush now, so I don't think
we'll see more of them," he said. What I had already seen
amply offset the $15 exchange charged me at the Zanzibar
bank.</p>

<p>Simba was the name of a station as we entered the game
fields; the meaning of the word "simba" is lion in the native
tongue. More than a score of persons were killed by the king
of beasts at this place, it is said, while building the railroad.</p>

<p>"Those smaller animals you see together yonder are a pack
of hyena," continued my traveling mate. "There are more
zebra to the left. The animals further along are blue wildebeeste
(gnu), larger than the South African breed. See the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
ostrich?" (pointing). There they were, big black and white
birds, with wings flopping, running over the plains, not a fence
within hundreds of miles&mdash;as wild as wild could be.</p>

<p>"We may see a lion before we reach Nairobi; I've seen them
on several occasions while traveling over this stretch of country,"
he added. A lion did not show himself, but, as my companion
said, they are frequently seen prowling over the treeless
plains from the railroad.</p>

<p>For over a hundred miles the traveler looks out upon great
herds of game feeding on both sides of the railway track.
Gazelles have become so tame that they sometimes keep grazing
as the train passes by; and the hartebeeste, or kongonie, much
larger than the gazelle, with a wedge-shaped head and an outline
of body resembling the giraffe, is nearly as numerous as the
clean-cut, nimble gazelle. The wildebeeste is seen feeding and
swishing his tail as contentedly as a cow in a pasture. Ostriches
and zebras are on their native heath. Tigers, and other game
also, may be seen while traveling through this most interesting
stretch of country.</p>

<p>These plains, like an American prairie, are free of timber; and
as far as the eye can see, from 50 feet off the railway track&mdash;to
the horizon, in fact,&mdash;from Makindu to Nairobi, over a
hundred miles, the eye feasts on a sportsman's paradise.</p>

<p>We reached Nairobi 23 hours after leaving Mombasa, 327
miles separating the chief port and the capital. What a terrible
mixture of blacks was congregated on the platform and
about the railway station! They were as numerous and black
as flies around a barrel of molasses on a hot day. We were
certainly in Darkest Africa. The ricksha is the hack of Nairobi.
One starts for his hotel, with a native in the shafts and
another pushing, a jingle-jangle taking place all the while.
The pullers, while less fantastic and grotesque than their Zulu
brothers in Durban, still have distinctiveness, namely, in wearing
small bells about ankles and arms; the tinkle from these
is constantly heard about the streets. For some distance from
the station one is drawn along a level road, bordered with
eucalyptus trees, to the business center. Wood and iron buildings&mdash;corrugated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
iron&mdash;are mostly used in both dwelling
houses and business places. There is no paving on the streets,
no sidewalks, nothing inviting, about the capital of the British-East
Africa Protectorate; but there is no grass growing on the
streets, every one seemingly infused with a "boom" spirit.
One finds, however, in this place a good, stone-built post office,
a stone-built Treasury building, and structures of the same
material under course of construction.</p>

<p>Nairobi was the blackest town visited. Though considerable
building was being done, a white man&mdash;such as carpenter,
mason, plasterer or bricklayer&mdash;was not seen engaged at that
class of work, all labor being done by Indians; most of the
contractors also were Indians. The wages paid these blacks
are from $1 to $1.25 a day. Natives carrying the hod, or
bucket, rather, are paid from 6 to 12 cents a day.</p>

<p>Mention was made in Leg Four of Suva, Fiji, having a daily
newspaper, by reason of two tri-weeklies appearing on alternate
days. In Nairobi, however, two daily newspapers appear on six
mornings of the week, and besides these there are also weekly
and monthly publications issued. Together with local news,
brief cable dispatches are printed, enough to keep one in touch
with important events taking place over the world. Even
linotype machines are found in that sparsely settled, out-of-the-way
place. The Indian here, as everywhere, when he gets
a foothold, has the printing trade killed in so far as a white
man getting good wages is concerned. He sets type after a
fashion for $15 to $18 a month.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may draw an accurate conclusion as
to the meaning of the term "Darkest Africa," Nairobi, with
only 1,200 whites, has the largest European population of any
city north of Salisbury and Bulawayo (Rhodesia) as far as
Cairo, (Egypt), or in the full length of Africa to the west and
northwest.</p>

<p>The negro is not the horse of Nairobi. While few horses
are seen, native oxen, with humps on their shoulders almost as
large as a dromedary's, lumber through the streets yoked to
wagons loaded with merchandise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>As the Zulu language is the key to the tribal dialects of
South Africa, the Kiswahili language is likewise the key to the
many native dialects in this section of Africa. The word "Wa"
is plural in the Kiswahili language, and is prefixed to the name
of a person or a tribe; "M" prefixed means man or individual;
"U," in the same way, means place or locality, and "Ki" prefixed
indicates the language. As an example, the Masai tribe
would be Wamasai, Mmasai would be a Masai man, Umasai
would be Masailand, and Kimasai would mean the Masai dialect
or language.</p>

<p>Professor Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, an exponent of the philosophy
of clothes, held that a majority of the people of the
world devoted too much attention to the matter of unnecessary
dress, a failing that militated against their moral and spiritual
welfare. The men of this tribe, gaunt and gawky, wear nothing
but a sort of shirt&mdash;a piece of cloth, with a hole in the
center large enough to admit a head through, secured by
neither string, band, nor suspenders. The original color of the
shirt might once have been a mongrel brown, similar to unbleached
muslin, but, as the Wakikuyu observe few wash days,
the "garment" is usually many shades darker. Shoes and
head covering, like the breeches, are also tabooed.</p>

<p>The Wakikuyu was the worst native tribe we had seen.
The men looked half-starved, and it was tiresome to see them
work. Excavation was being made for the foundation of a
building, the dirt being carried out in small pans; sometimes
these would not contain more than a cupful of earth. When
coming up the incline from the excavation to the street their
gait was that of a crippled snail. They receive from 6 to 12
cents a day, and possibly may earn it.</p>

<p>The women of the Wakikuyu tribe, on the other hand, are
hard workers. They till the land, and raise flocks of goats,
sheep, and cattle. They wear more clothing than the men, their
principal covering being a tanned sheep or goat skin that has
been soaked with grease. Dust and dirt coming in contact with
the greased skin naturally give the garment an untidy appearance.
What seems a cruel fashion among the women of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
tribe is the mutilation of their ears. The lobes are slit, and
thick chunks of sugar-cane, bamboo, calabashes, or other round
articles, from the size of a thread spool to the circumference of
a teacup, are pressed through. The plug and "ear bands" resemble
an elastic band a quarter of an inch in width placed
around a drinking glass. The plug is short, from two to three
inches in length. These are forced between the "ear bands"
so snugly that they will not fall out while the wearer is moving
about. The woman wearing the largest plug is the best dressed,
according to Wakikuyu fashion, and is envied by those of her
sisters whose ear-lobes will not accommodate the larger "ornament."
In many instances the punctured lobe is so extended
that it becomes a loop, the ends of which sometimes rest on the
shoulders. When not in use, so to speak, the ear loop is hung
up on the top of the ear and seems to be secured by a knot made
in that extended and flexible member. She carries her babe
inside her goatskin covering in front, and a heavy basket of
wood, potatoes, or other things on her back. A strap passes
across her forehead, the ends secured to the basket. The great
weights carried in the baskets make in time an indentation in
the forehead the width of the strap.</p>

<p>A native of that tribe would prefer to be killed rather than
touch anything dead&mdash;even a rat. If one of their number
should suddenly die in the hut, every one would immediately
move out and leave the dead member behind. Before taking
final leave of the old home, however, time is taken to dig a
hole under the side of the hut large enough to admit either a
jackal or hyena, when the body would be left to be devoured by
these beasts later. The Mkikuyu, though, in order to retain
his abode, takes care that few deaths take place in the hut.
When a member of a family becomes sick he is taken out of and
led some distance away from the home and laid on the ground.
Those accompanying the sick native may, with a short stick or
wood, the ends resting in two crotches made of four shorter
pieces held by a grass band, lay his head on the native "pillow,"
close to a lone thorn bush, with a short piece of goatskin covering
the body. If the negro recovers he is taken back to the hut.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
While thus holding vigil on the veld, a vulture may be seen
soaring above where the native is lying, with others appearing
to view in the distance, and in the background the forms of
jackals and the outline of slinking hyenas may also be apparent,
for these vultures and beasts seem to know, not alone through
instinct, but from former similar settings, that the body of the
native, when life has left it, will not be put underground nor
be removed by the superstitious tribesmen.</p>

<p>Many of the natives are smeared with reddish, greasy clay
from head to foot. The hair, worn long by some, is plastered
and shaped to resemble a turtle, with head jutting out and tail
extended. They wear no shoes, and seldom a hat. One sees
the native in British East Africa little different than he lived a
thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Men wearing two soft, broad-brimmed felt hats strikes one
as out of the ordinary. Nairobi is but 80 miles south of the
Equator, and heavy head-covering must be worn to guard
against sunstroke. Helmets are worn by a great many, but
the two hats, the top one over the under one, are worn as commonly
as the helmet.</p>

<p>A library is one of the features of the town. An electric
light plant was seen here; also bioscope theaters. One thing
Nairobi did not have&mdash;colored postcards that were of any
interest. Motor cars spin about the streets. Food, clothes
and living expenses are cheaper in Nairobi than in South Africa.
Hotel accommodation was but $1.60 a day.</p>

<p>Coffee growing is a promising industry of that section of the
Protectorate. A French mission is located a few miles from
Nairobi, and the fathers, some fifteen years ago, experimented
with the coffee bush. It proved a success, and several large
plantations have since been established. An exorbitant price
is asked for land in this district.</p>

<p>Irish potatoes grow in these parts, but not along the coast.
The altitude of Nairobi is 5,000 feet, and, while the sun is hot
in the daytime, the nights are cool.</p>

<p>Most of the big-game hunting parties are equipped in Nairobi.
The guides are about the town every few days, and a lion is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
guaranteed to be killed or no charge required. Eight lions
were killed not far from here during our stay. One may stroll
a mile from the center of the town, sit on a hill, and watch
herds of gazelle grazing not a half mile away. The black-and-white
monkey comes from this section of Africa.</p>

<p>"Boy! boy! boy!" is heard from nearly every room in a
hotel in the morning. Everybody has a boy to black his shoes,
lace his shoes, put away his clothes after dusting, get his shaving
outfit&mdash;the sort of waiting on that spoils the white man.
The hallways of the hotel are crowded with the guests' black
servants. No one thinks of carrying a valise or bundle of any
kind. The "boy" is expected to be in the hallway morning,
noon and night waiting to serve his master.</p>

<p>Mount Kenia, 18,000 feet high, located directly under the
Equator and 80 miles from Nairobi, may be seen from the
town any clear day; also Mount Kilimanjaro, 19,000 feet high,
about the same distance south of this place.</p>

<p>The Uganda Railway headquarters is located at Nairobi.
Some of the locomotives used on this road are of American
manufacture, easily distinguishable from English-built engines,
for American-built locomotives are the only ones which carry
a bell. The locomotive engineers are nearly all Indians. The
Uganda Railway is a paying concern, for dividends of 33 per
cent. are declared nearly every year. Passenger fare is reasonable,
but freight charges are said to be very high. It cost
$50,000 a mile to build the Uganda Railway, which is 584
miles in length.</p>

<p>The various native tribes have peculiar marks by which they
are distinguished. One tribe may have a certain tooth missing;
another the end of their teeth filed to a sharp point; still another
may have their teeth nicked, like a saw, done with a
stone; or by other marks, easily distinguished.</p>

<p>Horse racing, football, cricket, and other English sports are
indulged in. Saturday afternoon is devoted to recreation, as
the Saturday half-holiday is observed. Government employees
form a considerable proportion of the population.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>Nairobi was as far as we intended going when leaving the
ship at Mombasa, but, finding the country so new and interesting,
with traveling and living expenses reasonable, we decided
to press on to the shores of Victoria Nyanza. From Nairobi
going westward we rose to an elevation of 7,000 feet. Among
the limbs of the trees, while traveling over that part of the
railway line, can be seen crude, small barrels made of pieces of
wood; these have been put in the trees by natives to intercept
itinerant swarms of bees. The stations and surroundings were
literally covered with blacks&mdash;natives and Indians. With the
Mkikuyu woman, in her greased goatskin and plugged ear lobes,
and some of the men covered with the greasy, red clay from
head to foot, with hair fixed to resemble the turtle; with the
Indian wearing his cloth headgear, and the Indian woman with
her ankle and wrist bangles; with no Europeans in sight save
as passengers&mdash;British-East Africa to-day offers more of interest,
more for native study, than even interesting South
Africa.</p>

<p>At Escarpment a splendid view was afforded, for the railway
descends from a high point down the steep mountainside into
what is known as the Great Meridional Rift, or Rift Valley, a
depression in the earth that is said to extend to Egypt. As the
train travels down a woody mountain, to the left and in front
is the Rift Valley and Lake Naivasha. Traveling along we
come to another game preserve, where gazelles, hartebeestes,
wildebeestes, ostriches and zebras are grazing upon and scampering
over the great valley, unaware of the pleasure their presence
affords passengers while traveling through that stretch of
country.</p>

<p>No evidence of habitation is seen from the railway, yet people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
get off at stations&mdash;only stations&mdash;and often persons are seen
waiting at those lonesome spots in that wild land for the train
to take them beyond. The same took place when coming up the
coast&mdash;passengers got off and others got on the ship, though
no white settlements were in sight. It is marvelous how white
people settle in such untrodden sections in which to make a
living, surrounded as they are on every side by the wildest and
most uncertain phases of life.</p>

<p>Strange-looking berries were served at an eating station, and
on inquiry as to the nature of the fruit, we were informed
that an American had crossed two bushes&mdash;a strawberry and
a raspberry&mdash;and the result, half-strawberry and half-raspberry,
growing in that far-off land, we were now sampling.</p>

<p>We passed through Masailand, a native preserve, occupied by
what was formerly a troublesome tribe. They live on the
plains, and are said to own a quarter of a million head of
cattle. Passing through attractive mountainous country, from
Mau Summit, over 8,000 feet above sea level, we descended to
Kavirondo Valley, a flat country.</p>

<p>Naked natives, free from civilization's binding customs, hoeing
corn, weeding land, and watching sheep and goats, were
seen working in the fields. These were the Wakavirondo, a
tribe noted for its industriousness. They are chiefly engaged
in farming and gardening, and their products are carried to
Port Florence to be sold. Some of them have on a slight covering
when they go to town, but it is discarded a short distance
from where they left their produce.</p>

<p>Labor agents engage "boys" of the Wakavirondo tribe to
work for a certain length of time away from their district.
Of course, the men must wear some clothes. Returning in from
three to six months, they have become accustomed to wearing
covering and wish to continue doing so. Like the Maori
women, though, the women of this African tribe insist on maintaining
the custom of their ancestors, so the men have to discard
the clothes they had become used to and resume their
former clothesless existence. It is very warm where the Wakavirondo
live&mdash;under the Equator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>Port Florence&mdash;or Kisumu, as that place is more often
called&mdash;was now reached, and before us spread the blue, calm,
green-island dotted water of Victoria Nyanza. We were at
the western terminus of the Uganda Railway&mdash;the last railroad
piercing Africa in that direction. A railway station, a
dak bungalow&mdash;the only place at which to stop&mdash;and perhaps
a dozen houses built on raised ground, with good wharves,
a godown and a marketplace, almost completed the "attractions"
of Port Florence. Fever is very bad in Kisumu, and
smallpox and bubonic plague were holding a levee at the time
we visited the place. Bubonic plague is so common here that
no one pays much attention to it. Blacks are taken off with
the plague in large numbers, but few Europeans die from that
pestilence.</p>

<p>Trains run but twice a week from Mombasa to Port Florence,
and the lake boats connect with the trains; so if I remained in
Kisumu it would necessarily be for three days, and people die in
less than that time after having been bitten by the bubonic flea.
I did not relish the idea of possibly breathing my last just then,
nor at that place. The blue water was alluring, the green
islands bewitching, and in fancy we caught an echo of a call
from Uganda's shore, inviting us to cross the great African lake
and tarry a short while in the land of the Waganda. So, when
the vessel moved from the wharf on her voyage across Victoria
Nyanza, we were among the passengers.</p>

<p>The boats traversing that sheet of water are from 500 to
1,000 tons' displacement, lighted by electricity and of modern
design. Every available sleeping place was occupied, and the
vessel's water-line was concealed by the weight of her cargo.</p>

<p>A stranger would not know when he had reached the body
of the lake, as the course is through blue-water avenues, bordered
with tropical green islands, for a large part of the journey.
The distance across is 175 miles, and 24 hours was taken in
making the journey. The boats on Victoria Nyanza do not
travel at night, which accounts for the slow time. The Equator
was crossed and recrossed during the 24-hours' journey, but the
game of "Neptune" was not played. The lake is nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
4,000 feet above sea-level, 240 miles in length, and its area
26,000 square miles.</p>

<p>Although very fertile, none of the islands was inhabited.
For centuries most of these had been under cultivation, but the
sleeping-sickness plague made such havoc among the natives that
the British government some years ago forced them to the mainland.</p>

<p>Entebbe, on the western shore of Victoria Nyanza, is the
Imperial capital of Uganda, but Kampala, 23 miles north, is the
native capital. The British government officials are located at
the former place, while the native legislature convenes in the
latter. Most of the land of Uganda is owned by natives, but
no concessions are granted without the approval of British officials.
If one wishes to buy land, he must apply for it through
the native legislature. Uganda is a rich country, but little
land is under cultivation. Indians and Arabs would quickly
buy large tracts, but they are not wanted there, as no one
profits from Asiatic holdings but Asiatics; besides they would
ill-treat the natives. Uganda was made a British Protectorate
in 1894. It has an area of 300,000 square miles, that of
British-East Africa 200,000 square miles. Europeans in the
Uganda Protectorate number only about 2,000.</p>

<p>Built on a high point of land, with two blue-water bays on
each side and a wide sweep of Victoria Nyanza spreading out to
the horizon; evergreen landscape beyond the mainland borders
of the bays; trees smothered with vari-colored flowers, and the
streets carpeted with a floral covering which falls from them;
bright and pretty-colored birds enhancing the picture, with
their sweet carols "at early morn and dewy eve;" bulky banana
bushes and papaw, or mummy-apple, trees growing at every
turn; the gardens to the homes of the dwellers glowing with
flowers&mdash;there, away off in Uganda, on the peninsula overlooking
the great lake, at Entebbe, we found one of the grandest
settings of both land and water scenery the eye could feast on.</p>

<p>This was the first place we observed natives seeking work.
When coming from the wharf to the town, tidy, well-developed
Waganda would timidly approach, holding in their hands a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
small book or piece of paper. In the book or on the paper was
written their records, good or otherwise, the wages they had
received, and the length of time worked at various places. The
applicant may be a houseboy, cook or land worker. It is customary,
in fact a standard rule, when servants leave employment,
to give them a note, which is their reference. None of
them know a letter of the alphabet, so have no idea of the
nature of the writing.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the uninviting appearance of the
Mkikuyu at Nairobi and the naked Mkavirondo living on the
eastern shore of the lake. Here, over 400 miles west of Nairobi
and 175 west of Port Florence, we found the splendidly-built,
tidily-dressed, clean Waganda. The women of this tribe are
almost as well developed as the Zulu women. The Maganda
also carries loads on her head. It is hard to understand why
these natives, so far away from civilization, are so neatly dressed.
The Maganda is a good native.</p>

<p>We were but three miles north of the Equator, at an elevation
of 4,000 feet, and the comfortable climate, instead of an
almost unbearable one one would expect to encounter here, is
a surprise. In the evening the air became so cool that the
veranda was vacated for a seat inside.</p>

<p>Less than 150 white persons live in Entebbe, but with the
Arabs, Indians, and many natives, the population reaches 20,000.
Were government employees to leave, very few Europeans
would be left in the capital.</p>

<p>This was one place in which the moving picture was not to
be seen, and one is getting pretty well out of the world, so to
speak, when he has out-trod the sphere of that common means
of amusement. But there was a phonograph, owned by an
Indian, who lived across the road from where I slept. Indian
music is weird with a vengeance. The scale is cast in high C,
and the flats and sharps and other "harmonics" that went with
the music seemed to be like a clashing of rasps, files and grating
iron. At 2 o'clock in the morning the "tormentor" was
started, and its weird notes unmercifully pierced the equatorial
air until daylight. The police sometimes stopped the music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
for a couple of nights, but it was soon heard again. I became
well known at the police station through lodging complaints
against the owner of that infamous phonograph.</p>

<p>The wharf at the lake was piled high with merchandise and
cotton bales. Some of the imports were to be moved into the
interior as far as the Belgian Congo. The means of conveyance
was the heads of natives&mdash;porters, as they are called.
From 300 to 600 porters, all looking half-starved, assembled
in front of a shipping agent's office and waited for orders to
start on the trip. Horses cannot live in Uganda, so natives
take the horses' place. Sixty pounds is the standard load for
a porter to carry. The goods are packed and shipped in quantities
conforming to that weight, when it is possible to do so.
The articles carried may be grubhoes, chairs, a box containing
canned vegetables or food, a bed spring, bedding, a table, five-gallon
cans of oil&mdash;anything in the nature of food, clothing, or
household furnishings. When the article exceeds 60 pounds,
two, three, and even four porters, with bamboo poles, are assigned
to the load. The small army of porters&mdash;the African
freight train&mdash;start, with a stick in their hand and 60 pounds
of freight on their heads. The destination is Toro, 200 miles
further into Africa. White men are in charge of the "freight
train." Each porter takes with him a portion of rice or cornmeal.
His meat is furnished by the white men in charge, who
carry rifles, and by that means game is shot en route. Thirty
days is the time required to travel the 200 miles, and for carrying
60 pounds of goods that distance a porter receives $3. A
new "freight train" will take up the goods at Toro and advance
the cargo further into the wild country. Certain packs
of natives will not go further than the sub-stopping place, as
natives beyond are generally hostile to tribes stopping at that
point. In that way traders living in remote parts are supplied
with goods.</p>

<p>We were right in the heart of the sleeping-sickness zone. It
has been estimated that 300,000 natives have been swept away
by this strange and fatal disease. Remains of huts and other
mute evidences of tribal existence at certain parts of the lake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
districts indicate the wiping out of whole tribes by this pestilence,
which accounts for the British government forcing the
natives from the lake islands to live on the mainland. Some
of these ejected natives try to return to their old home, and
it was said to be a pathetic sight when they were forced to
change their abode. The islands are infested with the fly whose
bite injects the death virus. A strip of territory two miles
from the shore of the lake is prohibited ground, and legal punishment
is provided for any one found over the fly-infested
lines.</p>

<p>Sleeping sickness is caused from a bite of the tsetse fly. It
is as large as a horse-fly, and when it bites a victim it usually
draws blood. The poison injected infects the blood, and is
thought to be extracted from crocodiles by the fly while resting
on that beast. It may be weeks, and even months, before the
poison affects the victim. Anyway, mopiness will become noticeable,
then drowsiness, accompanied by loss of appetite; then an
overpowering desire to sleep overtakes the victim. All the time
he is becoming emaciated from lack of food. This condition
continues for months in some instances, and there are cases
where victims have moped and drowsed for years. Some of the
deaths are very painful, while others apparently die in their
sleep. Three flies, with Latin names, carry the sleeping sickness
virus&mdash;the Glossina palpalis, the Glossina morsitans, and
the Glossina fusca. They are generally termed "morsitans,"
"palpalis" and "fusca." The most advanced medical scientists
may be found in this part of the world trying to find out
something definite about the virus and devising means for its
eradication, but are as yet in the dark concerning how to combat
the suffering and fatalities that follow in the wake of this
strange disease. Sleeping sickness is prevalent in some parts of
Rhodesia, Central Africa and in other interior sections of the
Dark Continent.</p>

<p>The means employed to eradicate the fly is by cutting the
brush from the shore of the lake. A fly will not remain in
the sun long, so when the brush has been cut and a fly's resting
place, the shade, is removed, he leaves the brush-barren district
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
and seeks shady fields. A grass&mdash;lemon grass, it is called&mdash;with
a leaf a quarter of an inch wide, which grows to two
feet high, is often planted on the land from which the brush
has been cleared. The grass has an oily, lemon taste, which
the tsetse fly does not fancy, and he leaves the cleared section.</p>

<p>In the early days Stanley and those that came later to these
parts crossed the lake in canoes, rowed by natives. That was
a dangerous undertaking, as the lake then, as to-day, was inhabited
by hippopotami and crocodiles. As stated in Leg Two,
the "hippo" will not harm a person in the water, but he may
overturn a boat that attempts to ride over him, when the crocodile
would devour those cast overboard.</p>

<p>Most of the wild animals in that part of the world are protected
from hunters by government laws, but the hippopotamus
and the crocodile are left to the mercy of any who wish to kill
them. The big water-cows are very destructive to growing
grain and vegetables. They come out at night to forage, when
they destroy gardens, corn fields and grain. These animals
travel a mile or more from the shore for food. The only
time when a "hippo" will attack a person is if the latter
should be between the water and the beast.</p>

<p>Coffee and rubber plantations have been laid out and promise
large returns in the future. The natives raise a great deal of
cotton, and cotton gins are located at many of the lake ports.
So much cotton is produced that the lake boats cannot keep the
wharves and godowns from being overloaded.</p>

<p>Three years' growth is required before the rubber tree is
tapped. Several diagonal circles are cut in the bark. A piece
of wood, with sharp nails, similar to a hair comb, is pressed
against the tender bark. White sap then oozes from the tree
and runs down a gutter cut in the bark. At the end of the
gutter a tin spout connects, down which the latex runs into a
tin cup on the ground. An ounce of sap is produced from a
tapping. A tree is tapped every day for a month, then allowed
to rest for a month. Sap will run from a tree but half an hour
a day. Natives gather the cups from each tree, emptying each
ounce in a larger vessel. The latex collected is put in tanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
five feet long and six inches wide. The next day the sap is
taken out, when it will have become a white strip, like a piece
of fat pork. The slab or sheet of raw rubber is next put
through a press twice, which squeezes out water and impurities.
The sheet of raw rubber remains unbroken, and its thickness
is reduced to a quarter of an inch. It is then rolled together,
like belting, put into a drying place, where it remains for a
month, after which it is shipped North for refining. Before
tapping a tree the bark is cleansed with a carbolic acid wash.
The sap is white as milk, and sticky, and remains that color
until refined. An average of one pound of rubber a month from
a tree is a good yield, and the price ranges from $2 to $3 a
pound in the raw state. The trees will produce sap for about
ten years, and are from two to eight inches in diameter. Some
rubber plantations contain hundreds of thousands of trees, and
from 200 to 1,000 natives are employed. The wages paid
latex gatherers in Uganda are from $1 to $1.50 a month.</p>

<p>At the market place little cleaning-up was necessary, as
vultures pick meat blocks and keep the floors white after the
day's business.</p>

<p>A good botanical garden that any city of half a million population
would be proud of is found in Entebbe. Often groups
of monkeys may be seen jumping from limb to limb and from
tree to tree in the garden, each following the same route that
the first one traveled.</p>

<p>Missions and missionaries are quite numerous in that section
of Africa, almost every religious denomination being represented.</p>

<p>A ricksha is the usual means of traveling. When going
from place to place, three natives are assigned to a ricksha, two
pushing, with one between the shafts. These have bells tied
around their ankles, and they sing from the time they start
until they have reached the end of their stage. Each team
runs about five miles, when three fresh pullers take charge of
the vehicle; then the passenger will again spin along the road
at a speed of five miles an hour, cheered by the tunes of the
natives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"Safari" is a word much used in the Protectorates. When
one camps out, or goes on a country journey, he will be on
"safari." Often a man's standing is gauged by the number of
natives that accompany him. In the eyes of the natives the
man with the largest safari is the bigger man. For that reason
a vain man will have a larger force of natives serving him than
would be necessary were his position not gauged on that basis.
In that and in other ways white men become slaves to the
caprice of native opinion.</p>

<p>Natives living in that part of Uganda are ant-eaters. The
white ant, another African scourge, builds, unseen, large chocolate-colored
mounds of dirt, some of them eight feet in height
and from six to eight feet across the base. After reaching a
certain age wings grow on the ants, when they emerge from the
hill. The natives, aware of the time the exodus is to take
place, build a frame of sticks over the cone of the mound, over
which is placed a bark cloth. The cone is covered down the
sides to a place below which the ants will not break through
the dirt. Between the bottom of the upright frame sticks and
the mound will be placed a banana leaf, the center pressed
down, forming a trench. The ants, on emerging from the
mound, fly upward, when they strike the cloth covering and
drop into the banana leaf trench. Once their flight is interrupted
they cannot fly again. An hour's time is consumed
while migrating from the mound&mdash;from the time the ants
begin to come out until all have left their old home&mdash;during
which the natives are busy eating the insects that creep out
between the leaf cracks. They gather these by the wings,
which are an inch in length, and put the live ants into their
mouths, wings and all. The swarm of ants is later scooped
from the trench, put into baskets made of leaves, taken to the
hut, where the wings are plucked, and are then put into a pan
and fried. In keeping with the secret and interesting nature
of that insect, they do not begin to leave the mound before sunset,
and often not until dark. Also, in keeping with the generosity
of the Mganda, a member of this tribe, holding a number
of ants by their wings in one hand and putting these in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
mouth&mdash;having an equal number in the other hand&mdash;offered
to share the winged delicacies with his white spectator.</p>

<p>A variety of grass, from 6 to 12 feet high, called elephant
grass, grows in that country. Some ivory hunters have met
their death owing to wounded elephants secreting themselves
in the tall reeds. A hunter would naturally follow the tracks
of the great beast, though, being close to his quarry, he could
not see him; but the elephant could see the hunter. Before
he could protect himself or escape, the powerful trunk
would come down on the hunter and deal him a death blow.
Ivory from the tusks of the female elephant is the better grade.
Ivory smuggling is said to be practiced in that part of the world,
as opium smuggling is in some parts of America. While the
tusks of some elephants weigh 25 pounds, the average is 15
pounds. Export and import duty on ivory is very high, which
accounts for alleged smuggling in that product. Elephants
take 30 years to attain their full growth.</p>

<p>The two most dangerous animals in Africa are the buffalo
and the rhinoceros. Most animals will run from man, but a
buffalo may be just inside tall grass or a brush thicket, unseen,
when he will charge a hunter. The rhinoceros is almost blind,
but what he lacks in sight is made up for by his keen scent. As
soon as he scents anything he wishes to impale on his horn, he
starts in the direction from which he got his lead. When
closely pursued by a "rhino," the hunter will stand still until
the big beast is immediately in front; then he will side-step.
A man can turn much quicker than a "rhino," and in that way
one has a chance to get away, or to keep dodging the animal
until help comes.</p>

<p>Plural marriage is the custom with these natives, but a wife
in Uganda is one-half cheaper than in Zululand, from four to
six head of cattle being the standard price of a helpmate.</p>

<p>Bananas and sweet potatoes grow very bountifully, and these
two vegetables comprise the principal food of the natives. The
banana is boiled when green and eaten. The soil is rich and a
chocolate color.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>This was the only place in our tour of Africa where pretty
birds were seen and also were heard singing. Birds in South
Africa seldom sing. Parrots are on their native heath here.</p>

<p>The sun in that part of the world shines 12 hours a day the
year round.</p>

<p>Automobiles, motor trucks, motorcycles and bicycles may be
seen spinning along good roads.</p>

<p>My time had been overstayed in Entebbe, so we took our
departure for Kampala, the native capital. The lake stopping-place
is called Port Bell. Seven miles from the little port is
located Kampala, the ancient capital of Uganda, and that distance
is traveled in a government motor car. Rubber trees and
banana groves line the roadway for the distance. About
75,000 natives live in Kampala, but the huts are so scattered and
buried under banana bushes that one would not think there
were one-third that number. It is another Rome, so far as
hills are concerned. The government buildings are seen on one
hill, the King's house and Ministers' houses on another, and a
monastery and a mission stand on other hills. Four hundred
Europeans comprise the population.</p>

<p>Our next landing from Kampala was Jinja, another port of
Victoria Nyanza, and the most interesting of the lake stops,
as we had reached the outlet of that body of water, Ripon
Falls, where one looks at the starting point of the historical
river Nile, the magnet that figured largely in my giving way to
the witchery of the foreground when standing on the shore of
the lake at Kisumu some weeks before.</p>

<p>J. H. Speke, an Englishman, in 1858, discovered Victoria
Nyanza, but its outlet, hidden by green banks on each side,
was not reached until four years later, on his second visit to
that section of Africa. He named that neck of water Napoleon
Gulf. Speke was the first to reveal the source of the river
Nile, which had long been sought by the Egyptians, who had
for ages been in the dark concerning the fountain-head of the
river that meant so much to them in providing water to grow
crops&mdash;their life, in fact. When it is recalled that rain has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
not fallen for thousands of years in some sections of the African
continent through which the Nile flows, it is little wonder that
the Egyptians were eager to learn of the river's source.</p>

<p>Ripon Falls, named by Speke after the president of the geographical
society that financed his explorations, is located a mile
from Jinja, and is only 12 feet high and 400 feet wide, but
when that plunge has been taken the water becomes the river
Nile. From Ripon Falls to Albert Nyanza the river is known
as the Victoria Nile. On, on it flows through countries inhabited
by savage tribes&mdash;by elephants, rhinoceroses, lions
and hippopotami&mdash;through lakes and great swamps; still on
and on through the Soudan, and even further northward, where
it is halted for a time by the great Assouan Dam. It next
passes through the desert to Alexandria, Egypt, where it becomes
lost in the salted ocean, nearly 4,000 miles from its
source.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago visitors to Ripon Falls were forbidden
to go close to the section where the water makes its plunge
from Victoria Nyanza to the River Nile, as the brush growing
on both sides was infested with tsetse flies. The brush was
finally cleared and lemon grass planted. One is not quite safe
from being bitten even now, as on the opposite side the brush
is dense, and the distance across the river would be none too far
for a fly to journey. No one enters that brush unless their
hands are covered, and face and neck protected with a heavy
veil, to thwart any attack by that winged messenger of death.</p>

<p>From Jinja a railroad, the only one in Uganda, extends
northward 59 miles.</p>

<p>Returning by boat to Port Florence, then by train over the
mountains to Nairobi, we again feasted our eyes on big game
while traveling through the great preserve; next through the
Taru Desert, where the leafless trees grow; and finally we
rumbled over the trestle spanning the water channel separating
Mombasa Island from the mainland.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span></p>

<h2>LEG SIX
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>We now take final leave of Africa, the land of fever and
fascination, and start for India. The boat from which I disembarked
at Mombasa weeks before had sailed to Bombay,
returned to Africa, and was now again on her voyage to the
Pearl of the Orient. Only two Europeans were traveling second-class&mdash;the
only white passengers aboard&mdash;the others being
black. We had been at sea but a few hours when the
captain invited us to quarters in the first-class section without
additional charge. Seldom are passengers favored with such
kindness. The ship headed for the Island of Mahé, the largest
of the Seychelles group.</p>

<p>Before leaving Mombasa passengers had to be vaccinated,
as smallpox had broken out in that place. The port doctor
snagged my arm with an inoculation needle in three different
places, giving as a reason for doing so that he was sure none of
them would "take." Later, it became painfully evident his
opinion could not be depended upon in a matter of that nature,
as three flaming-like eyes appeared on my arm&mdash;all three
vaccinations had "taken."</p>

<p>A ship may enter the port of Bombay, India, though bubonic
plague and smallpox is ravaging the passengers, but if what is
known as a jigger is found on the feet or hands of a passenger
a vessel would be quarantined for eight days. The jigger is
a small insect that crawls under the toenail, deposits eggs if
allowed to remain, and then dies; its eggs, however, cause a
sore, which spreads over feet and legs, and the hands and body
eventually become scaly, somewhat like eczema. African natives
are very clever at digging out the jigger. The ship's doctor
examines every toe and hand of passengers booked for
India. He places a box on deck, when, one at a time, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
passenger puts first one foot on the box, when the doctor inspects
each toe, and then the other, for jigger indications. Several
days are devoted to this examination.</p>

<p>"A complete quarantine" was the order of the port doctor
when we reached Port Victoria, on the island of Mahé, Seychelles
group, the Mombasa clearance papers announcing smallpox
prevalent in the African town.</p>

<p>The coco-de-mer&mdash;a double cocoanut&mdash;is perhaps one of
the strangest products in the world; only in the Seychelles
group will the nut grow, and there on but two islands. After
the shuck has been removed the double nut is found, black as
ebony. A striking feature of the coco-de-mer is its resemblance
to the torso of a black person. The tree on which it grows is
like the cocoanut palm, and the nut is used for decorating homes
and clubs. The palm grows in sexes, male and female, only
the female tree bearing.</p>

<p>This group is composed of 29 islands, with an area of 153
square miles, and is located in the Western Indian Ocean about
a thousand miles east of Zanzibar. The French settled these in
1742, which remained their territory for 50 years, when England
added them to her possessions. The 30,000 inhabitants
of the islands speak the French tongue. Unlike most sections
of Africa, the climate here is healthful, the group being often
referred to as the Garden of Eden. Cocoa oil and vanilla are
the principal exports; tea, coffee, banana, cocoanut and other
tropical growths also flourish. The natives are yellow in color,
but not negroid. American five-gallon oil tins are in evidence
in that isolated "oasis" of the world.</p>

<p>We traveled northwest from Seychelles, when we recrossed
the equator, leaving behind the towering palms of Rio; the
circling albatross and pretty Cape pigeons, the whales, flambeau
trees, Zulu ricksha pullers, gold and diamond mines, Victoria
Falls, and shapely mountains of South Africa; Australia, New
Zealand, and the South Sea Islands; the interesting East Coast
of Africa and Zanzibar; leafless trees, game preserves, green-island
dotted Victoria Nyanza, nimble monkeys disporting in
treetops, ant-eating natives, pretty birds, Ripon Falls, the tsetse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
fly&mdash;mindful only of the interesting and fascinating&mdash;and,
lastly, the Southern Cross, as we say a final good-by to the attractive
Southland and the kind people living in that division of the
world.</p>

<p>"The anchor rattles down on stranger shores." We had
stopped at Morumgoa, Portuguese-India, where most of the
black passengers left the ship. Goa is the name of this Portuguese
colony, which embraces an area of 1,500 square miles, and
has been ruled by Portugal since the fifteenth century. Half
a million Portuguese subjects live in Goa, and from that place
comes the Goanese. They consider themselves Europeans, dress
like Europeans, but are as black as an Indian. Stewards on
passenger steamships in the East are generally Goanese, as they
make better servants than Indians. The passengers were returning
from Africa, where they had earned from $20 to
$30 a month, very good wages for them. They had saved
enough in Africa to live in ease at home for a long time, and
would send friends across the Indian Ocean to take their places.</p>

<p>Another day's travel within sight of the Indian shore, and
we sailed into the east bay of Bombay harbor, when a splendid
panorama&mdash;the city on our left, the bay in front, and green
hills and islands to the right&mdash;spread out before us. We had
reached Asia&mdash;Leg Six.</p>

<p>The Parsi (a Persian) is the financial power in Bombay,
coming to India a long time ago, when his empire was destroyed
by the Mohammedans. Persecuted by Indians for centuries,
his progress is entirely due to the protection he has received
under England's strong arm. Bombay has been an English
possession for 300 years.</p>

<p>The Parsi is lighter in color than the Indian, dresses differently,
thinks he is better than the native, will not eat food prepared
by others, and does not marry outside his own race. A
majority of Parsis wear spectacles&mdash;possibly one of the results
of tribal intermarriage.</p>

<p>One is surprised, on visiting this Parsi stronghold, at the
splendid buildings, rising bulky and high, about the city. The
streets in the business section are good and the walks in fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
condition. A good system of stone and cement docks impresses
the visitor. Ships are so numerous at this port that some of
the vessels have to remain in harbor for days, and even weeks,
before docking room is available. A large dry dock was under
course of construction at this time, and other important improvements
were in evidence all along the water front.</p>

<p>Trucking is done by oxen; horses are never seen drawing
heavy loads. The Bombay truck is a two-wheeled cart, thousands
of these, loaded with cotton bales and various merchandise,
slowly moving about the city all the while. When drivers
wish to speed their oxen they twist their tails. From this
method of forcing the animals, the pronounced corrugated nature
of their tails suggests that the joints had been wrenched
apart numerous times.</p>

<p>Bombay cotton mills number about a hundred and furnish
employment for over 200,000. Indian cotton is not so good as
that grown in the United States, and for this reason hundreds
of thousands of bales are imported from America each year to
mix with the native product. Cotton is worn mainly by the
natives, and, as the Indian woman has a weakness for colors,
groups of these make a picturesque showing.</p>

<p>Indian women work side by side with men and receive the
same wages. The work engaged in may be carrying earth
from an excavation, loading dirt into carts, shoveling coal, or
lifting bales of cotton. These are known as coolies, and no distinction
is made between male and female, English rule has
given some workers in India a short day, but others work 10
and 12 hours. The wages paid coolies in Bombay are from six
to eight cents a day. A woman may be carrying material to
masons working on a wall of a building and her babe be sleeping
behind a pile of bricks. When the child requires its
mother's attention the hod-carrier walks over to the infant, remains
a short while, then leaves, loads her basket with brick,
lifts it to her head, and starts up the ladder with the material.</p>

<p>Thousands of people in Bombay sleep on the sidewalk at
night. They completely cover their head and face, placing a
piece of old cloth under them&mdash;if so fortunate as to have something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of that sort&mdash;lie down, and sleep until morning. One
wonders they do not die of suffocation.</p>

<p>Usually the temperature is cooler at night than by day, but
such is not the case in Bombay, the weather being hotter at
night during the summer season than in the daytime, when a
breeze generally blows, and ceases at sundown. Then perspiration
seems just to boil out of one's body. Bombay being built
on an island, with water on all sides, one would naturally think
air would be noticeably stirring at night, but instead the bays
at this time of year are usually as calm as a mill pond. We
reached this country the end of September, and for three weeks
following the weather would not permit of even a sheet covering
at night. The weather is indeed hot in India.</p>

<p>The monsoons, or rains, begin the latter end of May, and
continue until the first of September. The rain comes in
showers, the sun shining between, when steam continually rises
from the ground. White women go to the mountains before
the monsoons, on account of the trying nature of the weather,
and also after the monsoons have ceased. The weather in
India is very depressing to white women.</p>

<p>Were one to walk about with bare arms on a cloudy day
they would become blistered. If one walked ten feet without
head covering, he would be apt to fall from sunstroke as quickly
as if felled by a blow.</p>

<p>Bombay, the fourth city of the British Empire, has a population
of a million, 15,000 of whom are said to be Europeans,
but it is doubtful if there be that number of full-blooded whites
in the city. Of this population, it would be interesting to know
what percentage wear shoes. Some Parsis do so, others wear
sandals; but no Hindus or Mohammedans wear shoes, and but
a small minority are seen with sandals. These are worn only
while walking, for it is the custom to leave their sandals outside
the entrance of a building or home and enter in bare feet.
No matter where they may be, the sandals are discarded at all
times when they are not actually walking, and when sitting
down their feet are partly concealed under them.</p>

<p>Hindus and Mohammedans do not eat pork, as they consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the meat unclean; neither is beef eaten by Hindus. This is the
reason why beef sells for five cents a pound. A cow is considered
a sacred animal by the Hindu, and therefore not to be
eaten. A shoemaker or saddler, or any one working with
leather, is of very low caste, according to Hindu social rating.</p>

<p>In the Five Towers of Silence, located on Malabar Hill, the
Parsi dead are disposed of, the method employed being one of
the strangest customs practiced. A long, stone stairway leads
to where the bodies are placed on an iron grating, which takes
four men to carry it. Here are five cylinders, of three compartments
each, 276 feet around and 25 feet high, resembling a
circular gridiron, with a depression toward the center. Under
the depressed portion of the cylinder is a well. Bodies are laid
on the grating naked&mdash;adult males on the outside compartment,
women on the center, and children near the well. Bald-headed
vultures being numerous in the trees growing about the
Towers, half an hour after a corpse has been placed on the
gridiron every particle of flesh will be stripped from the bones
by these vultures. The skeleton remains on the grating, exposed
to sun and wind, until it has become dry; then the body-carriers,
with tongs, remove the bones into the well. This
method of disposing of bodies, instead of by cremation, is due
to the Parsis regarding fire as too sacred to be polluted by
burning the dead, and water and earth are equally revered.
The bones and dust going into the same well is in keeping with
one of the tenets of their religion&mdash;namely, that rich and
poor must meet in death. The Parsis are followers of Zoroaster,
who is said to have brought sacred fire from heaven, which
is still kept burning in consecrated spots, while some of the
temples are built over subterranean furnaces.</p>

<p>The Parsi has a marked weakness for seeing his name engraved
on brass plates or shields or cut in polished granite. In
order that this whim be gratified, he donates large sums of
money to worthy benefactions. Their wealth and power may
be inferred when it is stated that the control of the city of
Bombay is in the hands of 80,000 out of a population of a
million. The poor are well looked after, and a high standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of morality is their boast. The adoption of European customs
becomes more noticeable from year to year. The children of
that race attend the public schools.</p>

<p>One style of hat or cap worn by the Parsi is of pasteboard,
covered with dotted white and red silk cloth, in the shape of a
horse's hoof. In the center of the cap a conical piece of the
frame points upward, but not so high as the top of the "hoof."
That feature of the cap suggests the frog in the horse's foot.
No rim, string or tassel goes with this odd headgear. Occasionally
a small feather may be seen at one side. Another
hat having a high crown, is made of cloth, without a rim, save
for what might be called a cuff around the bottom. His "coat"
is a long, loose garment reaching to the knees. The Parsi
horse-hoof hat, with adornment, will yet be well known beyond
the borders of India and Persia, for milliners will induce
their customers to adopt that style of headdress.</p>

<p>The city is well provided with parks. On the west side is
a large strip of land, on which English sports, including polo
games, are common; this park is used also for other forms of
recreation. Music is provided in this part of the city every
evening. In another section is located Victoria Gardens, a
very pretty place, containing a good museum and a creditable
zoo. Music is furnished in these grounds several times a
week.</p>

<p>An interesting type of the varied nationalities of Bombay is
the fisherwomen, who carry their catch in a basket on their
heads. They are a different race to the Hindu or Parsi, dress
differently, wear no head covering, and a sort of skirt they wear
stops at the knees, the center being caught up by a piece of
cloth brought between and fastened in front, giving the skirt
a baggy, trouser-like appearance; from their knees down their
legs are bare, including the feet. While their occupation would
suggest untidiness, yet no people in the world are superior,
in neatness of step and admirable carriage, to the Bombay fisherwomen.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note that Bombay "duck," appearing
on menus in the Far East, is really fish caught in the Arabian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Sea, which, after being dried, is shipped to many parts of the
world.</p>

<p>Bombay curry and rice is another food seen on menus in
cities a long distance from the place whose name it bears. A
gherkin is always eaten with this, the chief food of India.
Curry and rice is seen on menus all over the country, and it
is well for one to acquire a taste for it while in India, as it is
said to be good, and there is always plenty of it.</p>

<p>"Lac" is used in India to denote large amounts, as a "thousand"
is used in our country. There is a much larger difference
in the amount, however, as a lac is 100,000. Five lacs of
rupees, or three lacs of cotton bales, is the way the term is
used.</p>

<p>A garrywaller is a cabdriver, but "garry" is the general
term used when speaking of that class. The term "waller"
is used in the place of the word "smith" in the United States.
It would be tinwaller for a tinsmith, woodwaller for a cabinetmaker,
saddlewaller for a saddler, and so on.</p>

<p>Cab fare is cheap in Bombay. The charge for the first hour
is 25 to 30 cents, and 16 to 20 cents an hour after the first.
Short trips cost from 10 to 16 cents. One engaging a "garry"
should know the exact fare before starting, for a driver may
demand double the regular fare when the journey is finished.
The cab horses are a hungry-looking lot&mdash;like those of Paris,
France.</p>

<p>Jewelry and copper wallers form a considerable proportion
of skilled workers. Copper cups and vases are much used in
connection with religious customs, and Indian women will
starve themselves to save money to buy silver ornaments. As
many as six or eight ankle, wrist, and arm bangles are worn
by these women, besides heavy pieces of jewelry depending from
the ears, and flat ornaments covering the mouth. These last
are attached to a pin that has been pierced through the nose.
Mothers even have bangles on the arms and ankles of their
babies.</p>

<p>An Indian woman's dress is often composed of but one piece
of cloth&mdash;cotton or silk, as the case may be. On the amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
of money a woman has at her disposal depends the bulk of the
dress she wears. The strips of material are sometimes 20 feet
in length; they are caught up by deft hands and made into a
full fold, a half fold, or a V-shaped hook design, until a covering
of what seems an inch of cloth is around the figure, worked
out in shapes and designs to suit her fancy. None of the women
wear shoes or hats, the head covering being made of the bolt of
cloth composing her dress. The brighter the color of the material
the better she is pleased.</p>

<p>Several English daily newspapers are published in Bombay;
the leading one sells at six cents a copy. Employed in that particular
office are 1,100 persons, and out of that large force were
only nine Europeans working in the mechanical departments,
these directing the work of the several divisions. Here were
linotype machines and other modern appliances that mark the
advancement which has taken place in the printing industry
during the past 25 years. The "aristocratic" workers of that
office were the linotype operators, their wages varying from $14
to $18 a month&mdash;big salaries for India. A typist or linotype
operator would not hold a job long in America were he to bump
down and up the keys of these machines with but one hand;
yet that is the way the Indian linotype operator manipulates a
keyboard. Unlike coolies' hours, the working day in a publishing
house is but eight hours. The wages of other Indian skilled
mechanics in that office ran from $3 to $8 a month.</p>

<p>Modern machinery in any branch of industry in India, however,
is often run at a loss. In a large publishing house a
modern paper-folding machine had been installed at considerable
expense. After the machine had been in operation for several
weeks it occurred to the management there was little, if any,
financial gain noticed by the results. When the original cost,
wear and tear and ultimate replacement had been figured out,
the figures proved that the work could be done 600 per cent.
cheaper by hand. The folding machine was immediately
abandoned and the work again done by boys receiving from 4
to 6 cents a day.</p>

<p>The Bombay policeman's hat is yellow in color and resembles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
a thick pancake, with a firm rim. He carries a club, and
a small stick is another symbol of authority. He wears sandals,
and is not officious. If he be on a day assignment, his
time on duty is eight hours. The night policeman has much
shorter hours&mdash;two hours on and two hours off. This unusual
practice is maintained owing to an officer being very apt
to go to sleep while on duty. Mention has been made of the
weather being hotter at night than in the daytime, which may
explain the night policeman's tendency to become sleepy. These
protectors of the law receive $3.25 a month.</p>

<p>Electric street railways run to every part of the city, but few
Europeans ride in them. Not long since a white person seen
riding on a street car would be thought little of, but social
restrictions in this respect have relaxed to a noticeable degree.
Formerly Europeans were expected to maintain their position
by riding in a carriage. Street railway fare is cheaper in Bombay
than in Sydney, Australia&mdash;from 2 to 3 cents for a long
ride. The city is lighted by gas, but it does not reflect much
credit on the lighting department.</p>

<p>Every European living in India must be identified with the
local militia. It matters not whether one be a Britisher, a German,
a Frenchman, or an American&mdash;all white male residents
must be instructed in the use of arms. It is the fear of native
uprisings that demand the training of each European, to be able
to give the best account of his ability if confronted by hordes of
blacks intent on the most cruel forms of massacre. A large
garrison of British soldiers is stationed in Bombay, and even
a larger number at Poona, 100 miles east.</p>

<p>The food is nearly the same variety as one gets in other parts
of the world. One would expect to come across different
vegetables, but, with a few exceptions, potatoes, beans, peas,
tomatoes, onions and pumpkins rule the day. One does not
fare so well with eggs, however, as these are one-third less in
size than European or American eggs. The Indian breed of
chickens have long legs and a wide breast, so there is more white
meat than dark to the Indian fowl.</p>

<p>Elephanta Caves, located seven miles from Bombay, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
opposite shore of the eastern bay, is one of the attractions of
that city. Caves of this character are numerous in Southern
India, and most of them are worth a visit. The caves are underground
temples, and the sculpture, as seen in the gods carved
out of solid rock; pulpits, shrines, and images symbolic of their
faith, speak well for the people's skill in that art. The roofs of
these caves are supported by large stone columns. Nothing has
been overlooked to make these large underground places of
worship emblematic of their religion, no work or expense having
been too great to bring about that end. Elephanta and other
wonderful subterranean temples bespeak the Buddhist faith.
They were chiseled out in the eighth century. Thousands of
Buddhists visit and worship in the caves to-day. The Caves of
Ellora, however, are the greatest and most notable.</p>

<p>One would not expect to find away off in Bombay the prettiest
railroad station, perhaps, in the world; yet Victoria Station,
the western terminus of the Great India Peninsula Railroad, in
architectural beauty, will withstand critical examination. The
style is Italian Gothic, with Oriental designs. The building
is elaborately ornamented with sculpture and surrounded by a
large central dome. The station was built in 1888, and cost
$1,500,000. We know of a number of larger railroad stations,
but have seen none to compare with its rich architectural
appearance. Though Victoria Station is the prettiest structure
in Bombay, other splendid buildings would surprise a visitor
on his visit to the Parsi city.</p>

<p>A flat or an apartment for Europeans costs $30 a month.
Office rent is nearly as high in Bombay as it is in New York.</p>

<p>Good hotel accommodation can be had from $2 to $3 a day.
Usually a room is composed of three "compartments"&mdash;a sitting
room, dressing room, and bath room, but no running water.
Hot water for the bath is brought in copper kettles and emptied
into a wooden tub. It requires three Indians to look after a
room&mdash;a room "boy," bath "boy," and "sweeper." The
room "boy" is of higher caste than the bath "boy," and the
bath "boy" of higher caste than the "sweeper"; neither will
do work out of their caste position. Ceilings are high, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
many hotels are lighted by electricity. At sundown the room
"boy" sees that the bed is enclosed with mosquito netting, supported
on a frame. Most of the beds are of iron, with modern
springs.</p>

<p>One will not be in this city long before the large number of
black crows, with steel gray backs, flying about comes under
observation. At daylight their presence is forcibly brought
home, the medley of "caws" coming from these Indian scavengers
preventing further sleep of a newcomer.</p>

<p>America was prominently represented here in a sewing-machine
office, a cash register office, and the ever-present American
five-gallon oil can.</p>

<p>The native quarters is a black and busy place. Bombay is
perhaps more cosmopolitan than other Indian cities. Here are
seen the Arab, Afghan, Zanzibar negro, Persian, Beluchi, Chinaman,
Japanese, Malay, and representatives of other countries
and other sections of India. Bright-colored clothes appear occasionally,
but the denizens of the native quarters are more naked
than dressed. The bazaars are located here&mdash;the brass workers,
coppersmiths, and jewelers; and here everything native-made
may be purchased. Candy makers are among the "wallers"
of India, and the smell from these shops and the native
cooking-places&mdash;well, if one were blind, and at all used to
Indian life, he would know he were in the bazaar by the odors.</p>

<p>India is the home of the rupee. As stated earlier, its value is
32 cents in United States money. Then there is the half rupee,
16 cents; the anna, two cents; the pice, one-half a cent, and the
pie, one-sixth of a cent. Millions of people in India have
never had a rupee in their hands, being more familiar with the
pice and pie coins and cowrie shells, the latter being legal currency
in some parts of India. The value of cowrie shells
varies from 80 to 85 to the pie, or 500 to the American cent.</p>

<p>European data in connection with Bombay and southwestern
India is taken from the year 1498, when Vasco da Gama, the
daring Portuguese explorer, sailed around Cape of Good Hope
to Calicut. Portugal then assumed control of this section for
twelve years, when it was wrested from her, again coming into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
her possession twenty-four years later. In 1608 England appeared
on the scene, and in 1661 Bombay was ceded to Britain
as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. A few years
later the East India Company established itself here, and it has
remained a British possession ever since.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>Our next move was by rail to Baroda, 248 miles north of
Bombay. The railroad coach was of the compartment type,
but wide, the road gauge being 5¼ feet. Fare in India is
cheap, first-class being three cents a mile, second-class a cent and
a half a mile for short journeys and a cent and a quarter for
300 miles or more, and third-class fare one-sixth of a cent, or
a pie, a mile. To learn what heavy passenger travel is one must
go to India and note the jammed condition of the third-class
cars. Natives seemed to travel on railway trains to show their
friends they had money to spend on luxuries. At certain towns
a sub-station is located near the regular station, where third-class
passengers cook their food and sleep until the train arrives.
If they oversleep, it matters little, as they camp out until the
next train stops. Some of the coaches are equipped with shower
baths and luxuriously furnished; all of the through trains are
lighted by electricity and provided with electric fans. To add
to the comfort of passengers, ice is carried to cool the drinks.
The schedule time of some trains is 40 miles an hour. Coaches
are provided with free sleeping berths, as in South Africa.</p>

<p>My compartment companion was a sepoy (soldier) and a
Mohammedan, who had seen 24 years' military service, and
spoke fairly good English. He had laid in a supply of food
before leaving Bombay, and, when eating small cakes, offered
to share them with his European traveling companion; next a
cigar was proffered, and, not being a smoker, this kindness was
also declined. Indians are vain concerning scented water, and
this sepoy had saturated himself so thoroughly with lavender or
rose-water that the compartment smelled like a perfume factory.
He next offered fragrant water to put on my handkerchief, but
I did not take kindly to his taste. He carried two pillows, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
was disposed to divide these with his companion. Some interesting
facts concerning Mohammedan customs were gathered
from him during the journey, and when Baroda was reached
the sepoy asked, apologetically, if his presence had been objectionable.
In answer, he was handed a picture of one of the
high buildings in New York City.</p>

<p>One-third of the area of India is composed of what are termed
native States, the State of Baroda being among these. The
Gaekwar of Baroda rules over 2,000,000 subjects, and is
reputed to be the second wealthiest man in India. The richest
native ruler is the Nizam of the State of Hyderabad (Deccan).</p>

<p>A much better appearance was offered by the Gaekwar's subjects
than by the natives seen in Bombay. Baroda has a population
of 100,000, and a street-car line is among the city's attractions,
the cars being drawn by horses. Away from the bazaar,
or business center, Baroda is provided with good streets, with
trees growing on each side. A creditable park is located near
the city, the grounds containing a museum, an art gallery, and
a zoo.</p>

<p>A visit was made to the palace, in which is included the
legislative halls. We had been through palaces in Europe, but
the Gaekwar's bed was the most costly seen anywhere. It is
of solid silver, the posts being two inches in diameter, and everything
else connected with this democratic ruler's bed was fully
in keeping with the silver frame. Electric fans are placed
throughout the palace; while mosaic-tiled floors, mahogany furniture,
most expensive rugs, and drapings were also seen about
this Indian ruler's dwelling-place. The palace is surrounded
by attractive grounds.</p>

<p>Native rulers may govern their States, but England really
holds the reins of power. The ruler of the State of Mysore,
for instance, had his domain taken from him, but it was afterwards
returned. That will serve as an indication of what is
likely to take place if a maharaja opposes England's idea of
how to conduct her dependencies. The Gaekwar himself was
scotched by the British whip for turning the wrong way in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
presence of the King of England at the Durbar held in Delhi
several years since. Previously the Gaekwar's standing had
been recognized by a royal salute of 21 guns, and seven of these
were cut off. He now receives but a 14-gun salute for his unfortunate
turn at the Durbar.</p>

<p>Dak bungalows take the place of hotels in the smaller cities
of India, but even these are absent in remote towns. In order
that European visitors to Baroda may not be put to any inconvenience
concerning accommodation the Gaekwar has built
a special hotel, called the Rest House. Financially it is a loss,
but the Gaekwar is too big-hearted to allow his European
friends to undergo any discomfort while staying at his capital.</p>

<p>Large monkeys, two feet high, inhabit the trees here. They
are sacred animals to the Hindu, and, although destroying garden
and flower plants, no Hindu would venture even to strike
one of the tricky animals. If one of them was killed by a
European, that person, probably, would not get out of the place
alive.</p>

<p>The next stop was at Ahmedabad, where some of the best
temple and mosque architecture in India is to be seen. The
city has a quarter of a million inhabitants, and is noted for its
goldsmiths, jewelers, ivory carvers, lacquer workers, cotton-cloth
factories, calico printing, gold and silver lace, and other
industries that require high skill.</p>

<p>Feeding-places for birds&mdash;boxes on posts&mdash;ornamented with
carving and sometimes brightly painted, naturally arouse the
curiosity of visitors to Ahmedabad. A sect of the Hindu faith
in this city is known as the Jains; they erected the feeding-places
and supply food for the birds. This Buddhist sect believes all
inorganic matter has a soul, and that a man's soul may pass into
stone; but it is their concern for animal life, more than their
other beliefs, that interests. They will not kill an animal, bird
or insect. To maintain life in flies, bedbugs, mosquitoes, fowl,
dogs, and monkeys is a strict tenet of their religion; they also
believe bodily penance is necessary to salvation. This sect
numbers a million and a half.</p>

<p>The Jain temple&mdash;Hathi Singh Temple&mdash;is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
prettiest church buildings we have seen. Though it has not the
imposing appearance of the Cathedral of Milan, Italy, a view
of the Jain temple of Ahmedabad will long remain in one's
mind. The church, built of white marble, surmounted by 53
domes, will bring to mind, as a poor illustration, the handsomely
ornamented Christmas or wedding cakes seen in bakers' windows.
Woolen slippers must be worn on entering. The interior
is in keeping with the richness of the exterior. The
gods in the temple where the Jains worship seem to be made of
gold, although they may be of brass; they are two feet high,
and some are ornamented with what looks like precious stones.</p>

<p>In a mosque of that city there is a marble window, with
delicate tracery on stone of stems and branches. This beautiful
craftsmanship is in every detail equal to what one would expect
if the same design was worked by a deft hand lace-worker.
The window is six or seven feet across, and of the same height.
The tracery was executed nearly 300 hundred years ago. Formerly
there were two, but one was removed from the mosque
and taken to London, and is now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>In all the larger centers of India a garrison, or cantonment,
is located just outside the city, some of them composed largely
of native soldiers, with European officers in charge. Europeans
living in these centers occupy homes near the cantonments.</p>

<p>Ahmedabad streets are well shaded, and some of the houses,
though none too tidy in appearance, are beautifully ornamented
on the outside with wood carving. Beggars are numerous.
A wall, in some sections 40 feet high, with 12 entrances, surrounds
the old city. A good park is another feature, and the
old wells are an example of art in a high degree in the past.
The necessity for these wells will be understood when it is
stated that rain does not fall from the termination of the
monsoons until rain is again due, a period of eight months;
but the sacred tamarind trees do not die. All the cities of
India put one in mind of a rosy apple rotten in the center: the
outskirts are beautified with nice parks, good roads, and shady
trees, but the inside is always spoiled by a dirty, bad-smelling
bazaar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>Packs of big monkeys and homeless dogs&mdash;pariah dogs, they
are called&mdash;stand on the roads in the suburbs until a horse
almost steps on them. They are waiting for the Jains to come
with food. The pariah dog is generally mangy, scaly, starved,
and half mad when he is not actually snapping. Though a
menace to human life, if a European were to kill one it might
lead to an uprising in India. The mortality from rabies is
appalling.</p>

<p>Lizards were seen sliding about the walls, crickets were piping
from the corners, and frogs were hopping about the floor
of the room I occupied in Ahmedabad. No one of this sect
will kill a lizard, as he is a house scavenger&mdash;puts in all his
time catching flies and mosquitoes. The lizard is evidently not
a Jain.</p>

<p>A 24-hour ride was ahead of us before Agra could be reached.
The country passed through was as level as a table, with patches
of rice growing on each side of the railway track. Now and
again an irrigation trench is seen, and trees in cultivated fields,
while often separated by considerable space, give the landscape
a timbered appearance. Four poles, from eight to ten feet
above the ground, may be seen standing in fields where grain
is growing, on top of which a shaky platform has been built.
An Indian is assigned to this "look-out," to protect the growing
and ripening crops from invasions of destructive fowl and animals.
Rice will grow only in from three to twelve inches of
water. If the monsoons be limited, there will not be enough
water to grow the rice, and the dreaded famine results.
Though the monsoons had been good, the people looked half
starved; so we have no desire to travel through India in a
famine year. The Indian plough is perhaps an improvement
on what was in use 5,000 years ago, as it has a pointed iron bolt
in a stick of wood, but in the murky past the point of the
plough might have been wood. Oxen, with big humps on their
shoulders, draw the stick and bolt, and two Indians&mdash;generally
a woman and a man&mdash;seem to be required to work the
device. A long pole sticking in the air, with half a dozen to a
dozen Indians around&mdash;each woman with a baby astraddle her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
hip&mdash;is scaled by two or three men, a cloth no larger than a
pocket handkerchief about their loins, the top of the pole bending
to the ground as the men approach the end of it. A sort of
bucket&mdash;generally of earthenware, but sometimes an American
five-gallon tin oil can&mdash;is seen appearing on the surface with
water dripping from it. This is the windmill of India. When
the monsoons fail them, this is their only hope of getting water
from the wells to nourish the rice "paddies," and it is borne on
the head for long distances for the purpose of maintaining life.</p>

<p>Very few people drink water in India, as in most rivers it is
polluted by dead bodies, is used by "dobeys" (washermen),
and in other ways made unfit to drink, all of which causes
typhoid fever. For this reason much whisky, also soda water,
is drunk. Soda water on trains sells at four cents a bottle to
a second-class passenger and eight cents to a first-class passenger.
In this country one pays according to his position for any and
everything he buys.</p>

<p>Stations are not announced in India, and noticing "Agra"
on a board, in large letters, that place being a Mecca for
travelers, we fell in line with custom and left the train.</p>

<p>The chief attraction of Agra is the Taj Mahal, the greatest
tomb ever erected to the memory of a woman, and this in a
country where women are looked upon as merely servants of
men. The monument was erected by Shah Jahan, Emperor of
Delhi, to one of his wives, Mumtaz Mahal, "the pride of the
palace," as she was termed. Work began on the monument
in 1630, which was completed in 1652, 22 years being required
to finish the grand pile of marble. The sum of money expended
on its erection was $10,000,000.</p>

<p>The grounds in which the tomb stands are entered by an imposing
gate that would be a creditable monument in itself to any
great personage. When inside, the visitor is confronted with
a beautiful garden. A marble walk, in black and white, leads
to the noted monument at the other end, on the bank of the
Jumna River, where it rises in striking beauty, its stately marble
dome, marble walls, and marble minarets demonstrating the
grandeur in architecture for which the Taj Mahal is famed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
The marble platform on which the tomb stands is 313 feet
square, and the top of the dome rises to a height of 213 feet.
At each corner of the tomb is a minaret of white marble, 137
feet high, delineated by black lines. Some parts of the tomb
are inlaid with precious stones. Trellis work also plays a
conspicuous part in this magnificent monument.</p>

<p>The fort of Agra, built of red sandstone and nearly 70 feet
high, with a circumference of a mile, contains some magnificent
buildings of the Moguls, although portions have been demolished.
It was behind these walls 6,000 Britishers took refuge
during the Mutiny of 1857. The walls of the fort and the
buildings were erected between 1550 and 1640. Shah Jahan,
the Emperor of Delhi, who built the Taj Mahal, also erected
the greater number of fine buildings here within the great sandstone
walls. Among the material used in the erection of the
palaces is white marble with blue and gray veins worked in with
black marble, and white marble inlaid with mosaic and valuable
stones, rich reliefs enhancing the design. As in Nero's day,
there was an enclosure built, in which wild beasts tore each
other to pieces for the amusement of the Mogul. Artificial
flowers, made of valuable red gems, inlaid in white marble;
marble lattice work, treble marble domes, marble fountains,
walls embossed with gold&mdash;practically all marble&mdash;beautified
with red sandstone pillars and splendid vistas, with green parrakeets
flitting about the surroundings all the day, may also be
seen in this grand scheme of architecture. Such elegance, and
the vast amount of money spent in erecting these handsome
buildings, contrasted strongly with the dirty, squalid living
quarters of the poor, low-caste Indian, certainly indicates a
striking disregard of their interests.</p>

<p>Here one finds a creditable park, good driveways, shade trees
and large lawns in front of Europeans' homes. These dwellings
are bungalows, one storied, high roofed, with wide verandas,
and often covered with grass or reeds. The kitchen is not inside,
but a building in the rear is used for that purpose. Nearly
every one owns a horse and trap of some sort, and there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
stable included in the buildings. A fence generally surrounds
the grounds, and the inclosure is called a "compound."</p>

<p>Agra has a population of 200,000, and the articles manufactured
are gold and silver embroidery, carving in soapstone
and imitation of old inlay work on white marble.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan place of worship is a mosque, and the
Hindu place of worship is a temple.</p>

<p>A Mohammedan may have four wives, besides concubine
slaves. The celebration of a Mohammedan marriage costs the
father of the bridegroom about $150, which is used to buy
presents for the bride and to furnish a feast for friends. Any
prospective father-in-law attempting to shave that sum would
be thought little of by the bridegroom's acquaintances. Mohammedans
bury their dead, but use no coffin. They place the
corpse on the bottom of the grave, build over a frame, which
is covered with timber, cloth or stone, and then fill in earth.
Prayers are offered five times a day&mdash;at sunset, nightfall, daybreak,
noon, and afternoon. All work is abandoned at time for
prayers. Mohammedan priests use their voices to summon
worshipers to prayers, because Jews and Christians use bells
and trumpets for the same purpose. Mohammedans believe
in a resurrection, heaven, and hell, but also believe there is a
separate heaven for women. The Koran forbids the drinking
of wine or eating of pork. This sect wash their hands, mouth,
and nose before eating or praying. Mohammed, the prophet
of Allah, was born in Mecca, Arabia, 570 A. D., his father
being a poor merchant. Sixty-three million of the population of
India are Mohammedans, and the Mogul dynasties prevailed
from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Unlike Mohammed and the mountain, if one does not go to
the Indian bazaar the bazaar is brought to him. On a visitor
leaving his room, there will be spread before his door on the
wide veranda silk shawls, silk dress goods, and souvenirs of the
place; also waiting are snake charmers, jugglers, photographers,
"dobeys," tailors, shoemakers, barbers, guides, hackmen, fellows
offering themselves as servants&mdash;all making salaams&mdash;speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
in a low voice, but persistently following their business
instincts. One never finds himself at a loss for some one to do
whatever he wants done. An Indian may not be within sight
or sound, yet if one should make his wants known, the man he
requires will immediately appear as if having come out of the
ground. It is said that no secret can be kept from the native&mdash;he
seems to have the power of extracting any treasured thought
from the mind of a European.</p>

<p>Since leaving Bombay we had not seen a sidewalk.</p>

<p>We now head northward for Delhi, the country continuing
flat, with the same scenes, save for a deer appearing from grain
fields on several occasions as the train rolled along. Every time
the train stopped a native approached a coach that contained
high-class Indians or Europeans. He was a "boy" servant,
waiting to learn if his master needed his services. Nearly every
one traveling in India takes a "boy" with him, as it gives a
person a better standing with both natives and Europeans.
The wages for these servants range from $5 to $7 a month.
If one rides first-class, the servant rides free in the third-class
cars. His duties are to wait incessantly on his employer, look
after the baggage, and act as interpreter for a European who
cannot speak the native language. When in a city the "boy"
is no expense to his master, as he provides himself with both
food and lodging.</p>

<p>Delhi, the old walled capital of the Moguls, is under course
of rebuilding for the ninth time in its history. Calcutta was the
capital of India until 1911, when the seat of government was
changed to Delhi. Seven years was the time allotted in which
to build the government offices. Owing to the prevalence of
malarial fever, and the intense heat of the plains, two capitals
are maintained. Delhi is the official city for five winter months
of the year, and Simla, in the Himalayas to the north, the summer
capital for seven months. In one of the burnings and
sackings of this city, in 1756, Nadir Shah carried away with
him treasure amounting in value to half a billion of dollars, including
the Koh-i-Noor diamond. For a distance of six to
eight miles south of the city, pillars, earth depressions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
crumbled walls attest the onetime greatness of the new capital.
Delhi was founded by the Aryans more than a thousand years
before the Christian era, but modern history dates from the
year 1200. This city became British territory in 1803, and
a quarter of a million people live within its lines.</p>

<p>The financial year of married Europeans in India is nearer
eighteen months than twelve. Owing to one's business, a city
home must be maintained, and another, in addition, in the
hills&mdash;as the mountains of India are termed&mdash;for the wife
and children, for six months of the year, thus supporting a city
home twelve and a mountain home six months. The heat of
the plains is so trying to European women and children during
the summer that they must go to a cooler climate. Seldom
are white children over 10 years of age seen; they are generally
taken to Europe at that age to receive schooling and to
acquire a sound constitution, thus burdening the husband with
more expense. Few Europeans become wealthy in India.</p>

<p>From eight to twelve servants are required for a European's
household. The servant custom is maintained, even though
there is only a Sahib and Memsahib in a family, and one finds
what seems a surplus of servants about each home. In addition
to the head servant, there is a cook and dishwasher; the
husband and wife each have their separate "boy"; also a
gardener, and the "sice," who looks after the horse; a servant
to cut grass for the horse, that not being the work of a "sice";
a water-carrier, and a night watchman, or "chokeedar." Each
child in a household would have a nurse. The wages of these
servants range from $2.50 to $5 a month. One Indian will
not do the work of another&mdash;he will do only certain things
he was engaged to do. One often hears of tyranny of labor
unions in America, but the system in vogue in India of getting
work places labor unions in the United States in the light of
philanthropists by comparison.</p>

<p>An acquaintance who had been many years in India told of
his traveling by stage through a district inhabited by highwaymen.
The friend he had left assured him he need have no
fear of danger, as one of the gang of outlaws would be on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
seat with the driver. While passing through the highwaymen's
lair the vehicle was stopped by the bandits a number of times
on plunder bent, when the member of the gang who had been
engaged to accompany the vehicle would say the word, and
travelers were allowed to proceed. That is another way Indians
have of getting work.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find more attractive surroundings to any
city than the section of Delhi north of the walls. Parks, good
roads, monuments, and shade trees are in evidence. Among
the interesting features of Delhi is the monument to John
Nicholson, the Mutiny hero. It is a fine shaft of red granite,
with a bronze bust of the great soldier. The inscription, striking
in its simplicity, is: "John Nicholson." Four thousand
brave white men were lost in the siege of that city.</p>

<p>Shah Jahan, the Mogul Emperor who built most of the rich
buildings in the Agra Fort and palace, and also the Taj Mahal,
built the Mogul Fort and Palace in Delhi between the years
1638-48. He was every inch a king, so far as spending money
lavishly goes, as another building in the Fort, 90 by 60 feet,
built wholly of white marble, was inlaid with precious stones,
and the ceiling was of silver. One flooring a building with $20
gold pieces in Shah Jahan's day evidently would be looked
upon as a cheap imitator. The great value of some of these
buildings is still in evidence, several being preserved; but despoilers,
during the mutiny, ruined much of the beauty of the
palace which Nadir Shah left after he had carried away the
Koh-i-Noor diamond and half a billion dollars in treasure.
Some of these palaces are used to-day as messrooms and for
other purposes by British troops.</p>

<p>Some of the splendid mosques here swarm with beggars.
If a guide takes a visitor to these he is allowed to go no further
than the entrance. At some of the churches shoes must be taken
off in order to enter, and at all of them the shoes must
be covered, generally with canvas slippers. Money has to be
given to the fellow who puts on and ties the slippers. The first
usher takes the visitor to one portion of the church, and when
he has reached the end of his territory another usher takes his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
place. At these boundary lines a fee is expected. When one
reaches the outside he has paid six fees, and even there he comes
in contact with sundry professional beggars. The guide, in the
meantime, must be paid, and the garrywaller as well. But
such fees in India are not heavy, and hack fare is only from
15 to 30 cents an hour.</p>

<p>A prayer offered in a mosque is equal to 500 offered elsewhere,
and one prayer offered at Mecca is equal to 100,000 in
other sections.</p>

<p>The Kutab Minar, one of the grandest monuments in the
world&mdash;a tower of victory&mdash;is located seven miles from
Delhi&mdash;where the capital once stood. It is another of those
wonderful works of the Moguls. Its height is nearly 350 feet,
and the width of the tower at its zenith is nine feet. The
diameter of the base is 47 feet, and it tapers perfectly from that
measurement to the top. The first three stories are of red
sandstone, with semi-circular and angular flutings. The noble
monument has five stories, the two upper ones being faced with
white marble. Balconies are built at the base of each story of
the tower, from which a good view may be had.</p>

<p>As in Italy, holidays are numerous in India, and no work is
done on a holiday. It is on these occasions that the curtain is
raised and a broader insight of the people is obtained. Were
one to collect all the brightest colored cloth manufactured, and
specially arrange these to give the most gorgeous effect, the
kaleidoscope would not surpass what is seen in Delhi&mdash;in all
India, in fact&mdash;in raiment worn by the people on holiday
occasions.</p>

<p>I stood on the Chandi Chauk, the principal street of Delhi,
while a holiday procession passed. It took many hours&mdash;days,
on certain occasions&mdash;for the hundreds of thousands of
people from that section to squeeze their way through the street,
and every coping, balcony, roof and window above the street
contained as many human beings as the space would admit,
all dressed in gaudy cloth. High-caste Indians, dressed in
silks and velvets, rode in handsome carriages, drawn, in some
instances, by snow-white horses; lower-caste citizens rode in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
traps, with seating space on the sides, and drawn by donkeys
and oxen; throngs of barefooted, serious-faced natives mingled
among these, walking; further down the emblazoned street
could be seen a brown head appearing above the people, oxen and
horses&mdash;a camel, between high shafts, drawing a high-wheeled
wagon, the occupants being concealed by a large closed box, like
a van; this contained Mohammedan women. Hundreds of
low palanquins, their dark curtains extending from the roof
down the four sides, borne on poles, between which were two
men at each end, flitted in and out of the narrow streets; these
also contained Mohammedan women. The big Afghan, or
Kabuli, with his baggy apparel and full beard, also mingled in
the procession. Taboots, a fantastic design of mosque and
pagoda, the framework made of poles and covered with bright-colored
paper, lavishly decorated with tinsel and gaudy ornaments,
passed by, drawn by devotees of the Moslem faith.
Blare, grotesqueness, weird music from strange instruments, together
with the air of melancholy, induced by the beating of the
Oriental tomtoms&mdash;all very strange indeed. Holidays often
last a week, and some even extend to ten days.</p>

<p>Army officers relate interesting stories of that country. For
nearly a century elephants had been used to move army transports.
The food of the elephants was large cakes made of
wheat, and a dozen was a meal. The mahout, or cook, might
take a portion of the flour from the apportioned quantity and
keep it for his own use. Before eating the cakes, the elephant
lifted this food on his trunk; if the cakes were short of his regular
portion, he would set the food down and would not touch
it. A white officer, inspecting the animals at feeding-time,
seeing that the elephant did not look sick, would weigh the
food, and in every instance the scales verified the elephant's
refusing to eat because he had been cheated.</p>

</div>

<p>Indian women often cooked the cakes for elephants in a mud
fireplace, and the big beast would sidle to where his food was
being prepared. The basket for the woman's baby to rest in
was made of twigs, and a bent bamboo pole served as a handle
to the Indian "cradle." The Indian mother would slip the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
handle over the elephant's trunk, and the to-and-fro motion
of the beast would rock, or lull, the baby to sleep while the
mother cooked the elephant's meal.</p>

<p>House rent in Delhi is higher than in New York City. The
rents were increased a hundred per cent. when it was decided
to remove the capital from Calcutta.</p>

<p>A number of European stores were found in the capital.
Drug stores do the best business in India, as well as in Africa.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>We did not go farther north at this time, but traveled easterly
to Aligarh. A college is located here, some 1,200 students
being in attendance. This seat of education was erected and is
maintained by a wealthy Indian. It is non-sectarian, and Mohammed,
Hindu, Jain and all other sects take advantage of the
liberality of the benefactor. Strange as it may seem, the educators
are Europeans, and the language of the institution is
English.</p>

<p>An American mission is located several miles from Aligarh,
and the Europeans living in that city and district get their
bread from the mission. Few people take kindly to eating
bread made by Indians, as they have so many skin and constitutional
diseases and untidy habits that one does not know
what ailment he may contract from eating native-made bread.
A creamery is located near the city also, owned by a Swede.
Like the bread, Europeans prefer European-made butter, and
as a result there seems room for another white-conducted
creamery.</p>

<p>Living in this section is a remnant of a former wild tribe,
who existed from plundering and were being hunted by the
authorities most of the time. The Salvation Army obtained
permission to use an old fort as a mission, and most of these
highwaymen have found peace within its walls, being industriously
engaged in weaving silk. This section of India is
termed the Doab.</p>

<p>All white men in India own an evening-dress suit, generally
worn at dinner in their own homes.</p>

<p>Every one carries a lantern at night. Snakes are so numerous
and so poisonous that one's life is in danger. Some of the
Indian snakes are small, are very dangerous at night, and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
bite is almost certain death. The fatality from bubonic plague,
cholera, typhoid fever and rabies is appalling, yet it is said more
people die from snakebite in India during the year than from
any other single cause.</p>

<p>The most commendable feature of India that came under
observation was the free service of the bhisti (bee-ste), or water-carrier.
Men engaged in that occupation have a guild, or
union, and the rules of the organization forbid them making
a charge for water. The carrier's water-bag is made of leather,
in the shape of an inverted pig, and contains from six to eight
gallons. A strap is tied to both the hind and front of the pig-shaped
bag, which stretches across his right shoulder, the bag
being on the left side. A stopper is placed in the mouth of the
bag, which the carrier holds with his left hand. A cloth is
worn about the loins, and his legs are bare to the ground. He
usually wears a shirt, with short sleeves, and his head is covered
with a bulky piece of cloth wound round and round. Most of
the bhistis are bent forward and lean to the left, which is accounted
for by their carrying the bag on that side. He is a poor
man, but will serve water to either man or beast in need. He
is generally found about railway stations and other places where
large numbers of people congregate. Thirsty children may be
seen running to the bhisti, with empty cups in their hands, for
water, when he withdraws the stopper, places the spout above the
cup, and releases the thumb of his left hand at the mouth of the
bag, filling it. The happy child drinks and walks away.
A mother, with a water vessel in her hand, calls him, when he
pauses until the woman catches up with him, and then supplies
her need. The Indian mother might leave with him a pie
(one-sixth of a cent). As stated earlier, rain does not fall in
India at certain seasons of the year for periods of from five to
nine months, and water is water during most of that time.
Should the water-carrier pass an ox, a goat, a dog, or a horse&mdash;anything
in need of water&mdash;he at once eases his thumb on the
spout of the bag and relieves the suffering. He might call at
a compound with his bag full, and the master of the bungalow
would direct him to sprinkle the parched garden. After doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
so he walks away unless called to receive pay. The bhisti, in
short, practices what Red Cross societies aim to accomplish, and
what churches profess to do. He is the one star that shines
brightly through the dark, traditional sky of India&mdash;a messenger
of life in a land of suffering and death.</p>

<p>Clay cups, saucers, plates, bowls, and buckets are made in the
college city, the smaller vessels containing oil, with a cloth dip
added. Cities are aflame with these on certain holidays, and
from remote sections millions of clay-saucer lights burn throughout
the populous country.</p>

<p>Garlands are placed about the neck of guests when invited to
partake of an Indian's hospitality, these often extending to the
waist. They are made from flowers, leaves, paper, cloth, and
on occasions are composed of gold lace, and even more expensive
material.</p>

<p>No hotel or dak bungalow was found here; but on visiting
places without these conveniences, even if one be a stranger,
some European will extend an invitation to stop at his home.
European hospitality is another bright light that shines in this
dark country.</p>

<p>Wherever a few Europeans are found, a little English church
has been erected, and a bell will be heard ringing every Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>Cawnpore was the next stop. The first thing that attracted
attention was dust, which seemed six inches deep, quite a cloud
arising from it. When we left Bombay, sidewalks and paved
streets were left behind. This city has a population of 200,000.
It is a leather manufacturing place, and cotton mills are also
quite numerous. We visited Cawnpore chiefly to see the historical
Massacre Well.</p>

<p>Cow fat on cartridges, a desecration of the Hindu religion&mdash;the
cow being a sacred animal to the people of that faith&mdash;was
the fuse that ignited the mutiny bomb in 1857. Uprisings
by native troops had taken place at intervals for ninety years
previous, during which the domains of rulers had been taken
from them, higher pay for the sepoys refused, and pensions to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the deposed rulers' heirs cut off, the army being composed in a
large degree of high-caste natives.</p>

<p>Nana Sahib, heir to a ruler who had once been head of the
Mahrattas, was among those who did not succeed to the pension
his adopted parent received, $400,000 a year. At that time
40,000 British soldiers were in India and 240,000 Indians,
drilled in warfare by British officers. At Cawnpore there were
but 200 British soldiers, 30 officers and 3,000 sepoys. On June
6 General Wheeler, who was in charge of the British troops,
was warned to expect an attack&mdash;the siege had begun. The
ground was so hard that good trenches could not be built, and
the dirt was so dry it would not pack. Nine hundred, the
majority women and children, took shelter in the crude trenches.
Nana's forces were well armed, and a murderous fire came from
the enemy. The barracks of the besieged comprised two buildings,
one of which had a thatched roof, and the well from
which they got their water was exposed to the enemy's fire.
The thatched roof was set on fire and burned, and the occupants
were daily exposed to a sun varying from 120 to 140 degrees.
Deaths were taking place every day, and bodies were buried in
another well close to the barracks. An armistice was finally
agreed to after a 20-day siege, during which 250 out of the
900 died.</p>

<p>The terms of the armistice were that the British should leave
their guns and treasure behind, and that Nana Sahib would see
them, unmolested, to the river, where boats would be ready to
take them down the Ganges to safety. Four hundred and fifty
were left, and the boats were beached on bars of mud in the
river. Instead of being towed down stream, a murderous fire
of grapeshot and musketry opened on all sides. The boats were
covered with thatched roofs, and, these taking fire, many of the
deceived survivors were suffocated by the smoke of the burning
grass. Following, the sepoys jumped into the water and butchered
others of the party. At last the Nana's heart temporarily
softened, and he ordered that no more women should be killed,
and about 125 women and children, wounded and half drowned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
were then taken to Cawnpore. The men on the boats were
murdered.</p>

<p>In two weeks' time General Havelock had reached Cawnpore
with 2,000 soldiers. A week later an engagement took
place, in which the Nana suffered a crushing defeat, and at a
second engagement the mutineers were again defeated. The
Nana, learning that Havelock would soon be reinforced, ordered
the captives to be killed. The few men who were among
the women and children were brought out and put to death in
the Nana's presence. A party of sepoys were then ordered to
shoot the women and children in the building in which they
had been placed, but the soldiers fired at the ceiling of the
room. The Nana, being in a rage at his men refusing to shoot
the white women, ordered a party of butchers to put an end
to the captives, and a short time after entering the house his
orders had been carried out. Next morning all the bodies were
thrown in an adjoining well&mdash;since that time termed the
Massacre Well. This took place on July 15, 1857.</p>

<p>In the center of a beautiful garden a mound covers the well
into which the bodies of the 125 women and children were
thrown. On the mound is a memorial in the form of an octagonal
Gothic screen, in the center of which, on the actual well,
is a white marble figure of the Angel of the Resurrection, with
arms across her breast, as if resigned to the Almighty will, each
hand holding a palm, the emblem of peace. Over the arch is
inscribed, "These are they which came out of great tribulation."
Indians, except park workers, are not allowed in the Memorial
Gardens. If they were, some of them might be taken to
hospitals from time to time, we fear, as Europeans feel bitter
after having visited the Massacre Well.</p>

<p>Twelve years is the legal marriage of girls in India. Girls,
however, have a partner selected for them as early as two years
of age, and, if they do not wish to live with their husbands at
the legal age, they are taken from their father's home by force.
No matter how young she may have been when the parents
married her, she is the man's wife from that time. Should the
husband die after marriage, the girl, according to Indian custom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
cannot marry again. She may be a widow when she is 8 or 10
years of age. She is looked down upon, her hair sometimes cut
off&mdash;in short, she becomes the drudge of the family. She is
charged with having done some very bad thing which caused her
husband's death. Nothing is worse treated than a Hindu
widow. Fathers receive from $25 to $200 for their daughter
from the husband. Mothers 20 years of age will have "married"
daughters seven and eight years old.</p>

<p>If a poor Hindu were eating his portion of rice, or other
food, and a European happened to pass between him and the
sun, causing his shadow to flit over the native's food, the
hungry creature would not eat it, firmly believing it had been
polluted by the white man's shadow. Natives eat with their
fingers.</p>

<p>Were a man or woman to drop in a faint, or from any cause,
they would prefer to die before accepting nourishment from
one of lower caste, and certainly no one of higher caste would
lend aid. Only one of similar caste could relieve their condition.</p>

<p>Indians consider Europeans filthy who use a tooth-brush
more than once. They use a twig or sliver of wood that has
been chewed to a bushy end; it is thrown away after using.
People who eat pork are considered worse than dogs.</p>

<p>Men who wear trousers and shirt place the shirt outside
the trousers. Those who wear shoes have no socks.</p>

<p>Long, canoe-like boxes on cart wheels were in evidence in
Cawnpore. The oxen were hitched to a crosspiece at the end
of the shafts, while Indians, behind the oxen, were between the
shafts and pushing with their breasts against the crosspiece.</p>

<p>A European carpenter shoves a plane from him, but an Indian
carpenter pulls the plane toward him. Mechanics do most
of their work sitting, and use their toes as a vise between which
to hold a board while planing it. Before shoeing an ox, the
beast's legs are bound with rope, when the animal will be
thrown. The blacksmith then shoes the ox while he is sitting
down. The Indian can make as convenient use of his toes
as he does of his fingers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>Lucknow, next visited, is well provided with large tracts of
park space, splendid roads and good shade. The city has a
population of 300,000, and among this number were more Europeans
than at Cawnpore. Several good European stores
have been established, and these seemed to compete successfully
with the native merchants.</p>

<p>This city shared with Cawnpore in the horrors of the
Mutiny, as 3,000 souls were behind the historic walls of the
Residency when the siege began, and when relief came there
were less than a thousand alive.</p>

<p>Bedding is not generally furnished by hotels in India. Frequently,
the "bed" is only a bedstead and springs, or, as will
be found in smaller centers, strips of cowhide, lashed at sides,
top and bottom, answer for springs; again, there is a mattress
on the springs, but no bedclothing or pillows. At other times,
only one sheet over the mattress, and nothing else. Owing to
this unusual custom, a bag for carrying bedding is generally
included in travelers' luggage. The contrast between India
and Germany in this respect is very marked, as at a small hotel
in Berlin at which I stopped the bed had a sheet and a feather
tick for a covering. It was summer-time, but the covering
would answer for Arctic weather. In one case the sheet was
not sufficient covering; in the other the tick was too much.</p>

<p>One is more successful in beating down hotel rates in this
country than anywhere else. It is a place of haggle and barter,
and the business system aims to make a customer feel he has
got the better of the bargain, while the seller is satisfied with
his profit, although having come down from the original price
one-half. There is always doubt whether the customer really
has got the better of the transaction; but there is no question,
however, about getting a concession, when, after a hotelkeeper
has asked six or seven rupees a day, the traveler pays only five
rupees ($1.60) a day. It seems to break an Indian boniface's
heart to see a prospective guest go to another hotel.</p>

<p>"Babus" are men engaged at clerical work, and one has to
scan his hotel bill closely before settling, as a babu may add an
item to the laundry list or for ice, or even charge for other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
things that go with hotel accommodation. Many persons will
overlook a small charge, and well the babu knows it. Extras
belong to him.</p>

<p>The hotels are generally of one story, and all doors open on
to a covered veranda. Almost every one has a servant&mdash;a
"boy"&mdash;with him. Early in the evening and during the
night, in front of room doors, may be seen one, two and sometimes
three "boys" sleeping. If their master or any European
should pass where they are lying they hurriedly arise in their
blankets, salaam and bow, then immediately lie down again,
remaining thus until another European footstep is heard, when
up they jump, offer another salaam, and quickly settle down
again to sleep. As few Indians wear shoes, they know when
an European is approaching.</p>

<p>When leaving a hotel there will be four to six servants helping
the guest and his luggage into a conveyance. As most of
them look alike, it becomes necessary to ask each one what part
he played in adding to one's comfort while making his stay.
In answer to who's who, one will say he is the table "boy,"
another the room "boy," another the bath "boy," and yet another,
the sweeper. Others are also present to see one comfortably
on his way, but gratuities may be limited to four.
Three rupees&mdash;a dollar&mdash;proportionately divided among the
four is generally given for a week's or ten days' stay.</p>

<p>On entering the native quarters&mdash;the bazaars&mdash;of the Indian
cities one is generally escorted by "runners" of silk merchants,
brass manufacturers, lacquer merchants and others.
A friend and myself rode on a two-wheeled trap, the seat facing
backward; and as we entered one of the arteries of the
Chauk Bazaar the crowd of people and merchants' runners
that filled the narrow street from house wall to house wall was
so dense that the garrywaller gave up trying to proceed further.
It took us some time to reach the entrance on foot. No holiday
was being celebrated&mdash;this was an every day occurrence.</p>

<p>In all the cities of this section are sports grounds, a race
track, a church, and public library for Europeans. A large
cantonment is located in Lucknow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>The country over which we had traveled was so flat that it
looked as if there was no necessity for grading or cutting in the
railway of even two feet for a hundred miles. The "windmill,"
the stick-and-bolt plough, the irrigation trench, and an
occasional tree; the oxen, with humps on their shoulders; the
mud huts; the sparsely clad and half-starved natives were
scenes of similarity from Lucknow to Benares, the sacred city
of the Hindu. Benares is to the Hindu what Mecca, in
Arabia, is to the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>One beholds beggars, beggars, beggars&mdash;repulsive looking
specimens of humanity&mdash;and pariah dogs inside and outside
the temples; some of the enclosures of the temples alive with
monkeys and goats; cattle standing munching in front of golden
images of Hindu gods, up to their fetlocks in yellow flowers
and tender leaves; bony and poorly dressed women flitting in
and out of narrow alleys and through doorways into temples,
carrying a brass or copper water-pot full of Ganges River water;
vagabond priests on the "ghats," resting on a platform covered
with a large sun-shade, receiving money from very poor people
for making clay marks on their forehead&mdash;caste marks&mdash;all
sacred! Beastly and idolatrous would be a better term to
apply to Benares.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the population of India&mdash;207,000,000&mdash;are
followers of the Brahmanic faith, and even one of the lowest
caste believes he is a unit in the great universe as compared to
an Indian who has no caste distinction.</p>

<p>People of the Brahmanic faith come from all parts of India
to bathe in the Ganges River at Benares, which, by the way, is
nearly as muddy as the Missouri River. Their hope of a
peaceful hereafter is strengthened by a visit to the sacred city,
but the poverty and suffering entailed through spending money
for the trip by those living a great distance away is keenly felt.</p>

<p>At Durga, or Monkey Temple, which is surrounded by high
walls, 350 monkeys were climbing up the sides of the church,
scampering about the walls, but always keeping an eye on the
visitor. Upon entering the temple enclosure a priest insists on
one buying popcorn or other food for the monkeys; then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
second priest slips a garland of flowers over one's head, another
method of getting a little money. Besides monkeys, mangy
dogs come close, expecting popcorn, and impudent goats rub
their noses against visitors' clothes. The temple is painted an
ocher color, symbolizing the character of the god Durga&mdash;blood.
Many beggars were inside the enclosure, and were very
numerous outside. Everything about the place bore an air the
reverse of sacred or solemn.</p>

<p>The Golden Temple, hidden among many buildings, is the
most important to pilgrims. Three domes, covered with plates
of gold over plates of copper, ornament this structure; the floor
is said to be inlaid with 100,000 rupee pieces ($32,000). A
narrow alley runs in front of the temple, and only two persons
can pass at a time. Flower stands, and men selling flowers, are
plentiful about the entrance and along the passageway. Inside
the building are several shrines; in front of one stood a
Brahmani bull, and in front of another a Brahmani cow, both
animals having humps on their shoulders. Near the shrines
peacocks and deer were also seen. People were streaming in
and out of the temple all the time, those going in carrying a
water-pot, made of brass or earth, filled with Ganges water,
and a handful of yellow flowers and tender leaves, bought outside.
The flowers and leaves were fed to the bull and cow,
and the worshiper sprinkled the water over himself while paying
homage at the shrine. All the time a din from cymbals,
tom-toms and other harsh instruments was kept up, sounding
more like a boiler factory than anything else. Every one was
in bare feet. Most of the men wore only a loin cloth, and the
prominent ribs and other bones of their bodies suggested a
doubt of their ever having had a square meal. Around the
women's ankles were rings, around the wrists were cheap glass
or pewter bangles; the ears contained cheap ornaments, and a
gewgaw pendant hung from the nose over the mouth, secured
to the nostrils' partition. At every point of vantage beggars
and fakirs were as thick as flies. The constantly inpouring
crowd and weird music is kept up the whole day, year in and
year out. There is nothing doubtful about the sacred water&mdash;every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
drop is taken from the historical river and carried to
the temple. In some of the shrines is an image of a monkey, a
cow, a peacock, or a double-headed beast of awful appearance;
and gods in flaring red represent fire and thunder. All the
time priests are collecting money from the worshipers.</p>

<p>Many professional loafers, known as "jojees" or devotees,
are seen in India. They will hold up one of their arms for
years until it has become rigid and the fingernails have grown
and twisted about the hand like roots; some hang by one foot
from a pole, like the flying foxes of Tonga; or distort themselves
in other unnatural positions. This is done in accordance
with their supposed religious belief as bodily penance, and they
are looked upon as martyrs. Some of them have ashes on their
bodies, which they sell, mostly to women. Rice and money are
thrown to these knotty-whiskered, filthy fakirs by poor people
who really cannot afford the gifts, but who think they are doing
a religious act.</p>

<p>The view of Benares from the Ganges River is an unusually
fine one. On the high banks at this point stone steps have been
built leading from the top to the water. Above the steps and
banks stand attractive temples and palaces. At certain times
of year the temples are used by pilgrims who come from every
point of India to worship. Sections of the steps have proper
names, which are called "ghats"&mdash;used for the English word
place, as Dandi Ghat (place).</p>

<p>Over a million pilgrims journey to Benares each year, where
they bathe in the Ganges as a purifying tenet of their religion.
Among others, there is a small-pox ghat, where those suffering
from small-pox may bathe, in the hope of being healed; also
bathing ghats for other diseases, where purifying rites are
carried out. On each ghat are several raised platforms, having
large sunshades, where men, their legs half curled under them,
are sitting. Every one leaving the water stops at a platform,
where caste marks are made on their foreheads, each supplicant
leaving money with the marker. Some have no money coins
and leave cowrie shells instead. These markers are priests.
The pilgrims then wend their way to a temple and worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
either an idol painted red, having three eyes, a silver scalp, or
an elephant's trunk covered with a yellow bib; the figure of a
rat; a monkey of brass, wood or iron, or some other image. At
the temple the faithful make another donation, tom-toms, cymbals
and other instruments playing meanwhile to awaken the
gods of wood, brass or stone.</p>

<p>A few hours after death a body is brought to a burning ghat,
men being covered with a white sheet and women with a red
cloth. Smoke from a dozen to fifty pyres may be seen rising
from the ghat, and the ashes are thrown into the Ganges just
below. The fuel for a pyre costs $1.60; wealthy Indians use
sandalwood for this purpose. Children of five years of age
and under are not cremated, their bodies being cast into the
Ganges, with a weight attached. "Holy men" of the church
are not cremated; they are either buried or, like the children,
cast into the Ganges River.</p>

<p>Every pilgrim, on leaving Benares, takes with him a quantity
of Ganges water, though he may live a thousand miles away.
Were a European to touch accidentally a pilgrim's water-pot,
the Hindu would feel that the sacred water had been defiled.</p>

<p>Caste customs in India forbid intermarriage of one with
another; they must not eat nor drink together; must not partake
of food prepared by a lower caste, and shun even touching
the clothes of those beneath them. Were an Indian merchant
to adopt the Christian religion, his business would probably be
ruined, his home possibly be surrounded by a mob, and he would
be fortunate to escape with his life, having degraded his caste.
A man may be poor, and yet of a higher caste than some wealthy
Indians.</p>

<p>Women, with two blanks in their heads, may be seen begging
in many places. To raise her head when out walking as
a man passed is considered a violation of a wife's vow by her
husband, for which offense their eyes are sometimes literally
gouged out. High-caste women keep very much to their homes.</p>

<p>A white woman would be thought little of by her servants
were she to do domestic duties, such as dusting and putting a
finishing touch to the interior. Here are instances of how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
helpless some Europeans become when in India: Were a man
to brush his own clothes, or even lace his shoes, these acts would
prove sources of unfavorable comment by the servants. A man,
wanting to know the hour, sometimes calls his "boy"; the servant
takes the watch from his master's pocket, holds the timepiece
level with his employer's eyes, replaces the watch in his
master's pocket, and leaves the room. When keeping an appointment
with a servant, the master must not be punctual, but
keep the servant waiting. If the Sahib was punctual, and the
servant happened to be late, the master would be looked down
upon for waiting for his minion.</p>

<p>The cow is revered, not only owing to its service in maintaining
life by its milk, but because some of the Hindu sects believe
that, after death, they will be borne across a river on the
back of the cow to a better country. Hindus who do not wear
long hair have a tuft growing from the crown, or a little below
that point. In case the cow should fail to be on hand to
take him across, a mysterious arm is supposed to reach down,
take hold of his tuft of hair, and by that means place him in the
better land. One would be disgraced were the tuft of hair
removed.</p>

<p>Much of the ornamental brasswork seen in many parts of
the world comes from Benares, for which the Hindu Mecca is
famed. Small idols and images in brass or other materials are
made in large quantities. The brassworkers sit down while
turning out their product.</p>

<p>Ruins of the temples of Benares are located at Sarnath, five
miles from the city; these evidences of the past are seen in
crumbled walls and earth depressions. Brick and stone was
the material used in building, but the brick was much thinner
and longer than the present-day block. The most striking remains
standing of the ancient city is the Dhamek Stupa, or
tower, which consists of a stone basement, 93 feet in diameter,
the stones being clamped together with iron bands to the height
of 43 feet. Above that point the tower is of brickwork, rising
to a height of 128 feet. Niches built in projecting faces of
the tower contain the figure of Buddha, and encircling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
monument is a band of sculptured ornaments of much interest.
There is some doubt among authorities as to whether the stupa
has stood all these years; it is the only building of the ancient
temples at present standing. Another stupa, not as massive as
the Dhamek, was passed before reaching the ruins. At one
place among the crumbled temples is the Main Shrine, the whole
standing on a concrete foundation, with a rail on the upper
part of the altar. Close by is the Asoka Pillar, which is broken,
but was at one time 50 feet high, and is believed to mark the
spot where Buddha preached his first sermon.</p>

<p>Excavations are under way all the time at Sarnath, and a
museum located at that place contains a large variety of interesting
fragments of the early Buddhist temples.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>
<p>A start was next made for the Himalayas in a northeasterly
direction, seldom traversed by persons going to that section
of the mountain country. I was the only white man on the
train, and in view of few European travelers taking this route
no provision had been made for food. The third-class coaches
were packed with natives. We passed through the opium poppy
growing country, the sugar-cane and indigo fields, and, further
along, reached the jute-growing country in Bengal. The train
had left Benares in the morning, but it was twelve hours later
before food was available.</p>

<p>At a place known as Katihar I had to remain a day in order
to make through connections. One of the sub-stations, located
a short distance from the railway track, was alive with passengers,
but no one seemed to really care when the trains came
and went. Natives eating rice, wheat cakes, bananas, sticks of
sugar-cane, thick pieces of candy, rolls like crullers, smoking the
hooka (a long pipe with two bowls, through one of which,
containing water, the smoke from the tobacco or hemp passes to
the stem), gambling, begging; the big Kabuli&mdash;who looks like
a storm in silent mood&mdash;offering for sale alleged rare coins;
women with one to three very small children, all untidy and
dirty&mdash;such is life in India.</p>

<p>The train left Katihar in the evening for Silliguri. An
Englishman got in the same coach, and I was much pleased to
have a white man with me. This train was not lighted by electricity,
and there were doubts about the oil in the lamp being of
American brand, for the light went out before we reached the
second station, and when the train stopped the Englishman could
be heard shouting from the coach for some one to relight it.
The trainman had got no further than the rear of the train,
when the lamp gave a final flicker. The Britisher again began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
to shout, but the train was then moving. The three following
stops were a repetition of the first, and, the Englishman finally
admitting his defeat, we stretched out on berths for the night.
Most trains in India have berths in the passenger coaches, but
every one furnishes his own bedding. The next morning found
us at Silliguri, and in front were spread out the Himalayas.
From here a start was made up the mountains.</p>

<p>The Himalaya Mountains rise abruptly out of the flat plains,
a striking contrast to those of other countries. One would expect
the base of the Indian mountains to be at an altitude of
3,000 to 6,000 feet, but Silliguri, located a few miles from
where the ascent begins, is only 400 feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>The interior of the Himalayas is reached by means of a train
of small cars, drawn by a ten-ton locomotive over a two-foot
railway track. There are three classes of travel&mdash;first, second
and third. First-class fare is 12 cents a mile, second-class 6
cents, and third-class 3 cents. These fares include a very small
baggage allowance. First- and second-class coaches are of the
compartment type, third-class having curtained sides, with bare-seated
benches across. The schedule is ten miles an hour, either
going up or coming down the mountain.</p>

<p>The engine soon starts up an incline through a row of trees
on both sides of the track, with every seat in the coaches occupied
and the baggage car filled with luggage. The narrow
train turns to the left, then to the right; another sharp turn,
and puff, puff, puff, as a bend in still another direction is made;
down a decline next over culverts spanning rippling brooks and
under turnpike bridges, then up, when the grandeur of the great
range begins to unfold. Down grade again, the train stopping,
after traveling but a comparatively short distance, at a precipitous
wall. Backing out over a switchback&mdash;there being five of
these on the mountain railroad&mdash;we next creep up a steep, serpentine
grade. Houses above and houses and huts below, surrounded
by semi-tropical growth and cultivated ground&mdash;there
being little rock in the mountain&mdash;with stretches of low brush,
laid out in regular rows, below us, appear. A house and huts
have been built in these bush-like tracts of land; these are tea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
gardens. A screeching whistle diverts the passengers' gaze from
downward to forward&mdash;we were pulling into Kurseong, the
halfway station, where some passengers get off and others
board the train. The locomotive, being supplied with coal
and water, again begins to puff, puff, puff, up a steep grade for
a short distance, then eases down a decline. The mountain is
now so steep that the narrow train can worm its way no longer
about the side, coming to another switchback. Backing out and
again ascending, a silver streak is seen, far below, winding over
the plains&mdash;the Teesta River. Above, the sky appears to rest
on green mountain-tops. Upward the little locomotive climbs,
seeming to make sharp bends at every hundred feet. The mountainside
has now become a great tea plantation, and through
the hazy atmosphere the plains are but dimly seen. The sky,
which from below seemed to be resting on the point now reached,
is further beyond. Approaching an ever-receding horizon at
distant outposts from time to time leads one occasionally to
fancy he were bumping his shoulders against the arch of the
sky at sundry points of the outer circle. The narrow train
laboriously continues upward, while passengers direct their gaze
down gaping caverns, on the rim of which the railway track
sometimes rests. Further on, the grade gradually reducing
until traveling on a short, level stretch of road, the train stops.
We have reached Ghoom, the highest point on the line, where
more passengers leave and others get out of the coaches to
stretch their legs. Oh! a great white ridge, high above valleys
and tea gardens&mdash;it is Mount Kinchinjanga, whose summit
seems to intrude far into the sky. What seems like trespassing
on the sky's domain is explained when the height of the mountain
is made known&mdash;28,156 feet. The train again proceeds,
but down grade now, still winding and twisting&mdash;not over a
quarter of a mile straight track along the route&mdash;until a sharp
bend is reached. Then, as far as the eye could reach, the high,
white, stalwart peaks of the Himalayas were revealed in their
grandest form. Further on the train stops. We are at Darjeeling,
the end of the mountain railway, 50 miles from Silliguri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>Baden-Baden, Germany&mdash;where one can walk about the
splendid grounds for half a day and need not be exposed to the
sun half an hour&mdash;had appealed to me more than any other
place visited during my journeyings until Darjeeling was
reached. Here in the State of Sikkim, India, 20,000 feet below
the grandest mountain range in the world and built on the
woody sides of a lower range, are seen rippling streams on their
way to a parent river; attractively laid out tea gardens on steep
inclines; a panorama of dwellings spreading out to all points
of the city; deep, wooded valleys on either side, with rivers
coursing these, flanked by flowering orange groves; parks, botanical
gardens, and shady paths cut on the hillsides; observation
points and splendid vistas; then, seen through the blue atmosphere,
over low mountains, valleys, hills and trees, Jalapa La
Pass&mdash;17,000 feet above sea level&mdash;the route through the
Himalayan fastnesses to Lhassa, Thibet; and, now seen and
then unseen, as the many-shaped clouds flitted over and away,
the noble galaxy of white mountains, half circular in form, to
the front and to the right&mdash;Darjeeling can claim and deserves
a better description.</p>

<p>Everything seen in the mountain city was different to the
plains. The Bhutias, of decidedly Mongol cast&mdash;strong,
lighter in color than the plainsmen, with rosy cheeks&mdash;were
numerous, and it was good for tired sight to get away from
slender, half-starved looking men, and women without eyes.
Living in this section is another sect, or tribe&mdash;the Goorkhas&mdash;admired
by all white men for their bravery and feared by
natives. The water here was fit to drink, a luxury in India,
and the air was free of the humidity of the plains; the haughty
Bengali could be seen at nearly every turn, strutting about
bareheaded, his hair tidily brushed; and well-groomed European
military officers were galloping about the hillside roads and
paths on spirited steeds.</p>

<p>The Bhutia woman is the "horse" or "ox" of Darjeeling.
Like the Mkikuyu woman, she carries her loads in a basket, a
strap fastened to each side, which loops on her forehead. Few
level paths or roads are found in that section of India, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Bhutia woman can carry two maunds (160 pounds) in weight
up from tea factories miles below, and the same amount of coal,
provisions, or supplies from the cities to the settlements on the
mountain-sides and down to the valleys. She appeared as
strong as a Zulu woman, but not so big. The country is so
hilly that wagons can be drawn over it only in few sections.
Bhutia men are employed at ricksha work or carrying palanquins.
On account of the steepness of the surroundings, three
Bhutias are required to pull and push a ricksha&mdash;one between
the thills and two at the back of the vehicle. Seeing the Bhutias
wearing boots was something unusual in this country.
Brakemen, engineers and firemen employed on the mountain
railroad do not wear shoes, and the same applies to natives engaged
at the same occupation on the plains.</p>

<p>"Coolie, Sahib?" or "Coolie, Memsahib?" if man or
woman, is the language of the Bhutia woman when seeking
work. Going toward the market-place, one of these strong
women, with strap about her head and basket held by the ends,
will approach a person and quietly say, "Coolie, Memsahib?"
"Yes," was the reply one received from a lady on her way to
market. The Mongol woman followed, engaged in knitting
socks. After vegetables had been bought, the Bhutia woman
sidled to the dealer, turned her back, when the grocer placed the
vegetables in her basket; but she kept on knitting, apparently
unconscious of what was taking place. One will not look back
to see if she is following when leaving a stall; but at the next
vegetable stand, in another section of the market, the Bhutia
woman would be standing a short distance away, still knitting.
Every time articles were bought she turned her basket to the
dealer, had these added to the earlier purchases, and when the
marketing was finished she followed the memsahib to her home,
emptied the contents in the kitchen, received four cents for her
work, continuing with her knitting, as she zigzagged down a
steep incline in the direction of the market district. Bhutia
women are very unassuming in their manners. Some save
money, but most of this is spent on jewelry. Discs of gold as
large as the bottom of a saucer may be seen depending from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
ears, and large silver or gold bangles are worn about the wrist.
This weakness for display, however, often proves their downfall,
as they are sometimes found dead along the mountain
paths, stripped of every ornament.</p>

<p>Thousands of men and women are employed picking tea leaves
during the season. The tea is picked from the bushes mostly
during the monsoon season, as the new leaves sprout fast during
rainy weather. They work in wet clothes much of the time,
but the mountain natives are hardy, and pay little attention to
such discomfort. Men tea-pickers receive eight cents a day and
women six cents. Hut rent, garden, and medical service is
free. Over 3,000 bushes grow to the acre. Sunday is a big
day with these mountain natives; every one working on the tea
plantations for miles around comes to town&mdash;Bhutians, Thibetans,
Nepales, and other tribes&mdash;when the market-place and
bazaars literally swarm with them. In the Darjeeling district
are 60,000 acres of land under tea cultivation, and the output
is nearly 20,000,000 pounds a year.</p>

<p>The Goorkha is what is known as a "hill man," and is small-built.
He carries a short sword or long knife in a sheath at
his side, but will not show the weapon. It is an old maxim
with the Goorkha that blood must be drawn every time he
unsheathes the knife. Were he assigned to duty by a captain,
and a colonel wished to pass, the Goorkha would not allow the
superior officer to go through the lines if he had not received
orders to do so by the officer who gave him his assignment. He
acknowledges only one order&mdash;that of the officer who gave it,
be he high or low. Where the big Sikh would run or surrender
under a galling fire, the Goorkha, knowing no fear,
would advance and win a battle. His highest aim in life is to
have marked after his name when dead, "Died in action."
When mobs gather and a riot is threatened, if Goorkhas are
assigned to the scene and instructed to quell it, every one seeks
cover when it is announced, "The Goorkhas are coming." Indians
well know the Goorkha order will be followed. He is
the policeman of Darjeeling.</p>

<p>"The only supplies that reached the starving people of India
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
during the famine were those sent from the United States,"
was the refreshing information gathered from an Englishman
when touching on Indian matters. The supplies he referred
to were kept from native officials and looked after by American
representatives. Men get rich in India during famine years
through selling relief supplies at a high figure&mdash;sent to be distributed
free to the starving. Very few high-caste Indians have
any feeling for the suffering of a poor or hungry native.</p>

<p>One eats five times a day in India. Tea or coffee is brought
to the room generally before one is up; breakfast is served from
nine to ten o'clock; luncheon at from one to three o'clock; tea
at from five to six, and dinner from eight to nine o'clock.
Band music, bioscope, and other amusements take place, but are
finished before dinner. In hot countries Europeans bathe from
one to three times a day.</p>

<p>Along the bank of a river, stream, or pond may be seen dozens
of Indians doing their washing, and clothes spread out on the
grass to dry. They are soaped and rolled together and juggled
in the hands of the "dobey," and the next stage sees the same
fellow slamming them, with all his strength, against a rock.
One would look a long time for a washboard in India.</p>

</div>

<p>A trip was made to Tiger Hill, six miles from Darjeeling,
from which point of observation is seen the summit of Mount
Everest, rising to a height of 29,002 feet, located in the State of
Nepal, India. The space intervening between this point and
Everest is over 100 miles, and only a tip of the apex of this,
the highest mountain in the world, appears to view. But even
a peep at that premier pile of earth, rock, ice and snow will
partially satisfy the heart of one who yearns to see nature's
best in its varied forms. Everest, as seen from Tiger Hill, is
flanked by a peak on each side, both of which appear superior
to the king of mountains; but that delusion is accounted for by
the two plainer-appearing sentinels being much nearer to the
point of observation than the center white peak, Everest. It
is hard to believe that, if Mounts Cook, Ruapehu and Kosciusko
were placed one on top of the other, the combined height of the
three Australasian mountains would be lower than the dome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of Everest; or that, if Mount Aux Sources was lifted on top
of Kilimanjaro, these African mountains would be only slightly
higher than Everest. Also, that if Jungfrau was raised on top
of Mount Blanc&mdash;two prides of the Alps&mdash;Everest would be
only a few hundred feet lower than their combined height; and
were two of the most noted mountains of the Western Continent&mdash;Shasta
and Ranier&mdash;piled one on top of the other, the
culminating point of these would be several hundred feet below
the climaxing point of Everest. Then, from the corner of the
eye, while focussing the gaze on Everest, an imposing white pile
of grandeur&mdash;Kinchinjanga&mdash;second only to Everest, tempts
one to divert his view to its plainer seen and noteworthy proportions.
About Kinchinjanga, which rises its icy dome 28,156
feet above sea-level, clusters a noble family of sons, the Hercules
of mountains. Janu comes first, towering to a height of 25,304
feet; Kabru next, 24,015 feet; then Simolchun, with 22,270
feet to its credit, and Pandim, 22,017 feet. There are still
other noble peaks in the Himalaya range, plainly seen from this
viewpoint, that appear small when associated with the greater
monuments of nature's buildings.</p>

<p>All the natural agencies of earth, and those under the earth,
could not impair the grandeur of Mounts Everest and Kinchinjanga.
A fierce attack of wind and storm would only
amuse these giants, as the summits would be enjoying sunshine
during the day; in the afterglow, from the frosty flakes on the
snowy domes, would irradiate soft, golden gleams of light, and
at night from these flakes would also sparkle blue-white beams&mdash;reflected
from the stars above&mdash;while the elements would
be vainly centering their forces at invulnerable parts below.
Lightning could not disturb even a pebble on these climaxing
monuments, for ice and snow is so deep on their summits, and
for several miles below, that the rock-like, glacial crust would
prevent the forked thongs from penetrating to the surface soil.
Earthquakes might center their rending powers at these stupendous
vouchers of God's greatness, but the result, if any,
would be merely deep, wide breaches, so cleaved, mayhap, as
to form the design of the Cross or other holy emblem on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
prominent escarpment, and serve only to enhance their present
nobleness to a greater degree of reverence. And if the fires
under the earth should unite to destroy these Colossi of the
Himalayas, mustering every vestige of force and centering all
into one tremendous avulsion&mdash;the fires' fury finally succeeding
in forcing vents at the vertexes of these sky-piercing
peaks&mdash;even then, thus riven, Everest and Kinchinjanga would
gloatingly belch from their crowning domes rivers of liquid fire
and eject prodigious quantities of flaming rock and scoria,
spreading broadcast their sulphurous outpourings for hundreds
of miles around, their lurid streams coursing the sides&mdash;all of
which would only serve to draw people from every section of
the world to gaze on the fascinating and appalling spectacle,
that would measure second only in widespread flare at night to
heaven's own aurora in the early morning.</p>

<p>The term "timber-line," referring to mountains, means the
limit of altitude at which vegetation grows. Timber-line in
the United States is marked at altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000
feet. On some peaks, this line, often of stunted oaks six to
twelve inches in height and one to three inches thick, is as
decided as a steel band around a circular smokestack. Here
and in Thibet, in an atmosphere refreshed by high, snow-capped
mountains, the force of the sun is apparent by trees, and even
vegetables, thriving at altitudes of 15,000 to 18,000 feet.
Helmets must be worn in the hill regions, as on the plains, to
protect one from sunstroke.</p>

<p>The blue atmosphere&mdash;the sheen of the sky&mdash;in the Himalayas
is of a deeper color than that seen on the Blue Mountains
of Australia. The only place where a similar atmosphere was
observed in America was from Grand View, when looking into
the marvelous maw of the Grand Canyon of Arizona.</p>

<p>Vegetation on the lower mountains was different to that of
the plains. The magnolia was seen, also the oleander, the
chestnut tree, and the oak; but the bark of the latter tree was
different in color and shape to that of the American variety,
although the acorns were the same.</p>

<p>A large number of British troops are stationed at Darjeeling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and three forts have been built on the sides of a mountain facing
Thibet. Not even a goat could get through Jalapa La Pass
if the guns of these forts were trained on the noted mountain
passageway.</p>

<p>Darjeeling is a favorite vacation center for the people of
India, both European and native, in the summer season. In
addition to the natural attractiveness of this place, there is also
a museum and a library. Splendid mountain trips are at one's
selection.</p>

<p>Down the two-foot wide mountain railway we traveled to
Silliguri, boarded a passenger train, and were soon speeding
over the flat plains of Bengal, with Assam to the east. Palms
grow in that section of India, and the limbs at the bottom of
the bushy tops had been freshly cut and seemed to be scraped.
The native drink&mdash;"toddy"&mdash;is partly made from the juice
of the palm after fermentation, when it is used as an ingredient
with distilled rice. Hemp, or jute, reeds were lying in pools
of water along the railway track to soften, when the fiber
would be stripped from the stalk and later made into rope.
Sixteen hours after leaving Silliguri the train pulled up at
Sealdah Station, Calcutta, the second largest city in the British
Empire.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>Calcutta, although having a population a quarter greater
than Bombay, does not measure up to the Parsi stronghold in
architectural appearance. Still, one of the best municipal parks
in the world, the Maidan, is located in the center of the city;
it is two miles long, one mile wide, and is bounded on one side
by the Hooghly River and on the other by one of the principal
streets of Calcutta, Chowringhee Road. The Maidan is ornamented
by splendid monuments to men who took part in the
various mutinies, and those who, in the opinion of the British
government, wisely and bravely guided the affairs of this
country.</p>

<p>We had again got to where street cars were running, where
newspapers were published, masts on ships were to be seen;
hotels with two or more stories, electric lights, and big buildings,
also sidewalks&mdash;in short, we were in the largest city of
India. Fourteen hundred miles separate Calcutta and Bombay.</p>

<p>Street cars appeared better patronized by Europeans here
than in Bombay. There are two grades of travel to the city
cars&mdash;first and second class. The fare was cheap, first-class
three cents and second-class two cents.</p>

<p>Calcutta is better managed than Bombay, notably, fewer
beggars are allowed on the streets; and some features that do
not add credit to a city were under better control. Official
firmness in other ways was also noticeable. It was in the Province
of Bengal that the mutiny started, in 1857.</p>

<p>Modern machinery&mdash;linotype machines, web presses, and
stereotyping appliances&mdash;is in use on the daily newspapers of
Calcutta, and very creditable newspapers are published. But
there is little saving in modern machinery in India. An overseer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
of one of the printing plants stated that they installed the
linotype machines only to be modern, but that there was no
saving, in view of hand help being so cheap. The wages paid
run from $8 to $18 a month. The same applies to flour or
rice mills. Women may be seen in any part of India turning
two stones with which the rice and wheat are ground into
flour.</p>

<p>This city has a good business appearance, over 200 factories
being located within a short radius, a number of rope or jute
mills among them. Beside this native product, tea, opium,
grain, indigo, raw silk, and cotton are exported from Calcutta.
Some of the streets are literally packed with ox carts loaded
with these articles of export. Horses are used only for cabs,
oxen being the beasts used for vehicular traffic from one end of
the country to the other. As in Bombay, the joints in oxen's
tails have been broken so often by the drivers twisting them
that they resemble threads of a large wooden screw.</p>

<p>The Black Hole of Calcutta, into which 146 human beings
were forced on June 20, 1756, and out of which 23 came alive
the next morning, does not compare in savagery with the Massacre
Well at Cawnpore. Suraja Dowlah, the Nwab of
Murshedabad, had placed the 146 prisoners in the building, the
remainder of the British having made good their escape. Contrary
to general belief, the building called the Black Hole was
not a dungeon, but merely a lock-up for disorderly soldiers.
The prison, 22 feet long by 14 feet wide, was too small for
such a number of people. The time being June, torrid at this
season of the year, will account for the deaths. No butchering
took place, the detention was for but one night, and, to give the
Nwab his just due, the tragedy was unintentional, according to
some historians. Part of the space where the old prison stood
has been taken for a large building, and the portion not occupied
has been covered with black marble&mdash;the incident inscribed
on a slab of marble above&mdash;surrounded by a high,
black wire fence.</p>

<p>The Hooghly River, so called by Europeans, but termed
Ganges River by natives, is a busy waterway, and the sea, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Bay of Bengal, is not reached until a distance of 80 miles from
Calcutta has been traveled. This river is a large one, the water
muddy, and very treacherous for navigation. The same style
of craft seen at Bombay&mdash;the dhow&mdash;is the ship of the
Hooghly, and is similar to that in use thousands of years ago.
It offers a picturesque, though archaic, appearance. Hooghly
water is considered sacred by the Hindus living in this section.</p>

<p>Calcutta is not as interesting as Bombay, but there are three
things in the premier city of India that attract&mdash;the Maidan,
museum and botanical garden. Another feature, well known
throughout British territory, is the racecourse. The museum
is a splendid building facing the Maidan, and located on the
principal street; the collection would do credit to even larger
cities than Calcutta. The zoo is a good one, some native
rhinoceros here seeming three times heavier than the African
breed.</p>

<p>The botanical garden contains the great banyan tree, the remarkable
feature of which is that roots grow from the limbs of
the tree downward, take root on reaching the ground, and then
grow into the earth like a tree that starts from the ground.
From these aërial roots growing downward now stand over
200 trunks. The tree is not high, but spreads widely, the distances
separating the outer limbs from one side to the other
being 330 feet. The space intervening is studded with tree
trunks that, when young, had started from the limbs they now
support as props. The form of the banyan growth is circular,
so would be over 300 feet across from outer limb to outer limb
from any point. Around the circle of limbs the distance is
over a thousand feet. It is a beautiful tree, and well worth
going to see. The botanical garden is splendidly laid out, and
contains many strange varieties of growth.</p>

<p>European merchants have secured a foothold in Calcutta,
and a visitor is surprised to see the fine stores and large stocks
of goods carried. Even European barbers are found here, a
rarity in India.</p>

<p>Some European women, unfortunately, have married titled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Indians in the belief that a son or daughter would inherit their
father's possessions and title. High-caste women in India are
seldom seen walking about, as custom forbids such freedom;
so, after the European bride reaches her husband's country, her
life is that of a semi-prisoner. Her husband may be only a
rajah, with title outweighing rupees, in which event her home
might be located behind an odorous bazaar. Should she bear a
daughter, little is thought of the event, but should she bring a
son into the world she is very fortunate, if life by that time
has any charm for her, if she and the son do not accidentally
die in child-birth. Such a contingency as a Eurasian inheriting
an Indian's title and estate is not to be thought of. Her husband
will have a native wife in addition to his white wife, and
should the latter fail to bear a son he would take still another
native wife, and should there be no male issue from the second
native union he may take yet a third native wife. Where a
titled Indian is not succeeded by a direct native heir the custom
of adopting heirs is common. A white wife's offspring, however,
has no hope whatever of becoming the reigning heir.</p>

<p>The Eurasian is half Asiatic and half European. His social
standing is really pitiable, as Indians hate him because he is
neither Indian nor European, and white people, for the same
reason, do not encourage social equality.</p>

<p>Kali Ghat, or Kali Temple, located some distance from the
business center of Calcutta, was dedicated to Kali, the wife of
the god Shiva. It is a terrible place. Mercenary priests, eager
to obtain a fee, almost fight for the privilege of showing one
about the gruesome premises. Two posts, a space of eight
inches separating them, were raised from the ground three feet,
through which holes had been bored to correspond. Two pins
were put through the holes of both posts. To the rear was a
shed, in which were standing at least a hundred half-grown male
goats. The posts were located close to the entrance of the
temple. A goat was brought to the posts, the upper pin pulled
out, the goat's head placed between the posts, when the pin
was inserted in the holes, the space between the pins&mdash;about
four inches&mdash;preventing the goat from pulling his head backward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
A brass pot, containing water, rested on the ground,
from which a man took a handful of water and sprinkled
it on the goat's neck. This was Ganges water&mdash;holy water.
Without ceremony, the man who had sprinkled the neck of the
goat swung a big knife over his head, and when it was brought
down the goat's head was severed. A woman squatted
at the trunk end of the severed neck, with a brass cup in her
hand, catching the dripping blood. When the first flush of
blood ceased she quickly arose and literally ran to the temple
entrance. Inside, she offered the blood sacrifice to the god Kali.
All the time weird-sounding gongs and music came from the
interior of the temple, the heads of goats being severed at frequent
intervals in front of the entrance, each having been bought
by the disciple making the blood offering. From that scene the
priest takes a visitor to the burning ghat, and in the instance
related there were six pyres consuming dead, but none of the
"mourners" looking on gave the slightest intimation of grief.
Two hours' time is required for burning, and the price of wood
for that purpose was $1.15. The ashes are thrown in a lagoon
of the Hooghly, or Ganges, River. Church holidays in India
are called "pujas," and great crowds frequent Kali Temple on
certain puja occasions.</p>

<p>Large numbers of native babies are mortgaged before they
are born. The country swarms with baniyas, or money-lenders,
who are a curse to India. Parents who wish to visit Benares,
the sacred city, borrow money to defray expenses of the trip.
Weddings often cost a considerable sum for poor people&mdash;from
$25 to $150&mdash;and, in order to maintain their caste position,
people borrow the necessary rupees. Famine years, sickness
and other causes also force the people to borrow money.
The rates of interest are very high. Land in India is of hereditary
ownership, and rajahs and maharajahs charge a high rental
to the worker. An income tax of 12 per cent. is collected on
a yearly income of $300 and above.</p>

<p>Saugar Island is located at the delta of the Hooghly River,
and Hindu widows wend their way in large numbers to what
the Hindu avers is a sacred bathing place. As stated earlier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
widows are held responsible for the death of their husbands,
although the wife might be but five or six years of age when her
husband died, and living with her parents, and the husband
from 20 to 60 years of age, having other wives. The traditional,
withering contempt and inhuman disregard for these
creatures cause widows to resort to any form of deprivation,
degradation and self-punishment&mdash;some of which are having
their hair shaved to the scalp, although they prize it highly;
cast any money and jewels they may have into the ocean, if a
crafty priest does not catch the arm and obtain, and retain, the
treasure before it leaves their hands; bathe in the waters, even
though the breakers be mountain high, knowing they will be
swallowed by the sea; trudge from holy shrine to sacred altar
in various parts of India&mdash;all in the hope that their sacrifices
and atonement may satisfy the wrath of the gods they are supposed
to have provoked by taking away from earth the husband
who bought them from their father. A Hindu widow is
thought much less of than a pariah dog; she is the most pitiable
object on earth.</p>

<p>Leaving European and official sections of Calcutta, one comes
to street after street without sidewalks; with heavy ox-cart
traffic; natives as thick as flies, but no white people about; the
usual vile odors coming from the bazaar section; bony, half-dressed,
ragged people at every turn&mdash;all with somber faces.</p>

<p>The native of the Province of Bengal is the proudest man in
India, and is said to need watching in transactions of every kind
more than those from other parts. He seldom wears head-covering,
his hair is smoothly dressed, he is erect, and walks
with a pompous stride. One can always tell a Bengali, as he
appears neater in appearance than Indians from other sections.
His looks betoken his thoughts, for he entertains the opinion
that he is the essence of human kind in India, or even of the
world. As in all other cities of this country, the streets were
poorly lighted at night. Calcutta is a new city compared to
other places in India, as it dates back to only 1690.</p>

<p>There being no rickshas in Calcutta, one of the means of getting
about is by palki, an upholstered box, seating one person.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
The box rests on poles, and four coolies&mdash;two at each end&mdash;the
poles resting on their shoulders, lift the palki and fare and
start off at a trot. They receive 12 to 20 cents an hour for
carrying a person&mdash;three or five cents each.</p>

<p>After crossing the Hooghly River bridge, a railway train was
boarded at Howrah Station, a modern and creditable building,
for Madras, over a thousand miles southward. The trains on
that road were not as good as some we had traveled on in other
sections of India, but sleeping berths were included with the
equipment. The Indian reminds one of the American negro
in one respect&mdash;that of sleeping. He seemed to be at home
in any place, so far as sleep is concerned, for in the coaches
during the day the berth would be taken down in the compartment,
and, slipping off his sandals, he would soon be fast asleep.
One peculiar feature of this sleeping tendency, however, was
that he would always be awake when the train reached his
destination, as stations are seldom announced.</p>

<p>Save for hills in the distance, the country was as flat as any
passed through while traveling over the Doab and other sections.
Sugar-cane was one of the crops seen during the journey,
and peanuts was another.</p>

<p>After 40 hours' travel the train stopped some distance outside
of Madras, as passengers had to be examined by a doctor
for disease indications, and the train was detained until that official
duty had been gone through. In most countries boat passengers
must undergo a medical examination when reaching
port, but it was the first time we had been subjected to a railway
train examination. This precaution was taken to keep out
bubonic plague.</p>

<p>The conquest of India by England, as it may be termed, had
its inception in Madras, for in that city British merchants first
established themselves. The East India Company grew more
powerful as time passed, first acquiring sections of land and
later provinces. The founding of the East India Company
dates back to 1639. This section of India is known as the
Southeast Presidency, and is presided over by a governor, appointed
by the King of England, Madras being the capital.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>Madras, with a population of over half a million, is the
prettiest city in India we have seen. The River Cooum winds
its way through the Tamil metropolis by a very circuitous
route, and the land for some distance along the banks has been
reserved for parks. The government buildings are attractive,
shade trees are numerous, and the city is abundantly supplied
with parks and driveways. We had reached the sea again. A
splendid drive and promenade has been built on the shore of
the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>The natives in this part of India are known as Tamils, and
it is from here the Indians in South Africa and those in Fiji,
and possibly those in the United States, came. The reader
will have gathered from my earlier notes an idea of some of the
miserable creatures encountered during the journey, but the
Tamils met with in Madras, those with whom one comes in
contact in the nature of servants, ricksha pullers, and that class,
were the worst in all India. One would no sooner have stepped
into a ricksha than the puller would place his hand on his
stomach and then to his mouth, which meant he was hungry.
No doubt they were in need of food&mdash;a majority of the people
of India are not half fed&mdash;but the striking feature of Madras
was that every one who did anything for a person was practically
a beggar.</p>

<p>The first Christian church built in India was St. Mary's, in
Madras. Elihu Yale, the benefactor of Yale College, is identified
with St. Mary's by his presenting to that building one piece
of the church plate. The United States also is represented by
a splendid Y. M. C. A. building of red sandstone, the benefactor
being a noted merchant.</p>

<p>It is really surprising, when one visits a city like Madras, so
far away from the more enlightened centers of the world, to
find such a large number of colleges and other means of education
there. In addition, this place is well supplied with a
Y. M. C. A. building, libraries, club buildings, churches of
various Christian denominations, a museum, a zoo and an
aquarium. The same applies to the larger centers of India in
general, but not in such proportion as those of this city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>Titled Indians, when visiting England, are sometimes received
by the King and Queen, and are next entertained by
lesser royalty, this attention being given much publicity in the
British press and also cabled to other continents. But in India
the social lines are not so flexible. European clubs in the Far
East are popular centers of association, and a native sovereign's
application to become a member of one of these, though composed
even of European clerks, would very likely receive
unfavorable consideration.</p>

<p>The punkha is the fan in general use in India, except that in
some hotels in the larger cities electric fans are in service.
Rods or ropes are secured to screw-eyes driven in the ceiling,
and to the end of these a pole or wire is fastened that extends
across a room. Canvas or palm leaves are attached. This
covering, which falls from the pole a foot to eighteen inches, is
the source of air when moved. There may be a dozen of these
"fans" stretching across a large dining room; and tables are
placed under the punkhas. These are connected by a string
or wire running from the first to the second punkha, and so
on. A stout rope, tied to the first punkha, is placed over a
small pulley in the wall or partition, extending outside the building.
An Indian, unseen, pulls the rope, when the fans in the
room move, and air will be stirring. Frequently the punkha
puller dozes off, when the fans will move slowly. One knows
then he will soon be asleep.</p>

<p>Thousands of half-starved coolies, nearly naked, with a
squatty basket made of bamboo strips in their hands or on their
heads, may be seen in any section of India. That basket is his
"work-box," in which he carries anything required.</p>

<p>An umbrella is the sign of authority in this section of the
world where a group of natives are engaged at work. Whether
the weather be wet, cloudy, or clear, the Indian foreman is
known by his holding an umbrella.</p>

<p>A finger bowl is placed at the side of every plate when serving
food in India.</p>

<p>The word "calico" had its origin in India. The city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Calicut, whence the word calico is derived, was a cotton goods
manufacturing center in early times.</p>

<p>Madras, the third largest city in India, is composed mostly of
Hindus, and where that sect is found the sacred cows and bulls
will be in evidence, as well as the miserable widows, the burning
ghats; the mothers who give their young daughters to depraved
priests who persuade the parents they will gain special
favor in the sight of the gods for so doing; the goat-slaughtering
places, the idols of monkeys, snakes, and other characters, and
juggernaut cars. The Hindu has little to recommend him in
either person or religion, and yet the best-fed things we saw
in that country were connected with the church&mdash;the sacred
bulls and cows.</p>

<p>The native quarters and the temples were the same as have
been touched on in our Indian notes. The bazaars were the
same, and there seemed to be more nearly naked people, owing
to the weather on the Coramandel coast being warmer than
that further north. One wonders how Europeans stand the
heat, as few cool breezes blow in the hot sections of that country
to refresh the jaded.</p>

<p>Mention has been made on several occasions of the appalling
mortality from fevers and pestilence. A considerable portion
of the mortality may be accounted for, however, when the reader
learns that there is practically no sewerage from east to west
and from south to north in this thickly populated country.
With no sewerage, and the habits of the people as a race being
the opposite of clean, together with all of the Hindus holding
in reverence venomous snakes and mad dogs, and some sects
bedbugs, mosquitoes, and vermin, the wonder is not at the great
number that fall victims to these various causes, but how to account
for so many being alive.</p>

<p>Madras was the last stop in India, as a train was boarded for
Tuticorin. We passed through a country that is celebrated for
its splendid temples, which are strange to understand when one
sees the crude tools and archaic methods employed to do ordinary
kinds of work. In the artistic designs and richness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
construction of some temples and mosques one sees the acme of
art, and in mechanism the mien. Judging from the latter, it
might seem that some skilled race of people had made their
abode in that country during the period of construction of some
of the buildings, and then had passed out, unseen, as it were.
The people of India, as they appear to Europeans, with their
marble and gold buildings, seem to be a contradiction. The
country was flat to Tuticorin, half of it being under water, the
monsoons just having ended.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>The sail from Tuticorin to Colombo, Ceylon, is 147 miles.
The first thing one notices in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon,
is the large number of natives wearing very little clothing.
Ricksha pullers are as numerous as flies and very annoying, as
they follow one about the streets for an hour in the hope that
the visitor will patronize the two-wheeled sulky. Where men
and women are dressed, it is hard to tell which from which, as
a large number of the men wear long hair, tied at the back in a
knot. In addition, the high-caste Singhalese wears an amber-colored
comb just under the crown of his head; it is what
women call a backcomb. A great many of these are made from
turtle shell and are very expensive, based on the wealth of the
wearer. Men's clothes look more like a dress than man's apparel,
so, when men are seen wearing long hair, a backcomb,
and a sort of dress, one looks on them as half-women. The
women are much given to wearing clothes of flaring-colored
cloth, but there is still a strong reflection of India on all sides.
The best way to appreciate Ceylon is to visit that island before
visiting India, for after one has passed through India and then
visits the lesser country he will not absorb some of the beautiful
and interesting things for which Ceylon is famed, because of
the noted mosques, temples, mountains, and teeming millions
found in the greater country.</p>

<p>The congested population of Ceylon may be inferred from
its area&mdash;25,000 square miles&mdash;containing over 4,000,000
people. The island is 270 miles long and 140 miles wide
at its broadest part. Since 1796 the island has been under
British control. The exports are interesting, as they include
tea, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa, cocoanut oil and rubber,
besides other tropical products. Ceylon is administered by a
governor, who is subject to the Secretary of State for the Colonies
in London.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>Scaffolding used in Ceylon and other Eastern countries when
erecting buildings is odd. The supports to which the floors of
the scaffolding rest are bamboo poles, and the crosspieces and
other material used to work on are held together by rope, no
nails being used. The scaffolding is so bulky, crude and shaky
that the walls of a building look as if they were out of plumb,
but the scaffolding nearly always hides the new building entirely
from view.</p>

<p>Most of the ships plying Eastern seas stop at Colombo, and,
with the exception of Port Said, it is perhaps one of the most
popular maritime stations in the world.</p>

<p>The buildings of Colombo would not suggest being in far-off
Ceylon. They are composed of brick, stone, and mortar,
several stories in height. The streets are clean. Colombo,
however, is the rosy apple with the decayed center, as a mile
from the European or business center is the Pettah, or native
town, with its squalid quarters, narrow streets, ox carts, absence
of sidewalks, people barefooted, and many of untidy
appearance. More English is spoken in Ceylon than in India.
The population of Colombo is nearly 200,000.</p>

<p>A splendid driveway and promenade runs along the ocean
front, and is paved from the city to a well-known hotel. Also
a good park and museum that is interesting. Cinnamon trees
grow in the park, and from the bark of the trees a cinnamon
odor arises. There are two qualities of the cinnamon, known
as quills and bark. The quills look like bark strips taken from
a sapling, and are over a foot in length, tied in bundles. The
export of cinnamon from Ceylon is 120,000,000 pounds of bark
a year. All the vegetation about Colombo is tropical.</p>

<p>One of the social gauges by which a European is measured is
the class of railway coach in which he travels. If it be a second-class
coach he is thought little of by the natives, and is apt to
get the cold shoulder from Europeans. When a white man
has become a victim to the liquor habit and loses self-respect in
the black countries a collection is generally taken up among
Europeans to buy his passage to some other country.</p>

<p>Some 6,000 Europeans live in Ceylon, which accounts for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
newspapers being well patronized, both in the city and throughout
the island.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest trips in the world is from Colombo to
Kandy, 75 miles separating the two cities. One meets with
cocoanut palms and other tropical growths in the hot countries
along the sea coast, but to travel through a tropical section on
a railway train for that distance is unusual. The train passes
through a stretch of heavy vegetation, then an open strip of
country, with bright green-colored rice paddies (fields or
patches) on both sides of the track. Next the train is flanked
by groves of cocoanut palms, which disappear when the train
darts into a tunnel. Emerging, on the side of the hill will be
seen growing the broad-leafed breadfruit tree, and a similar
looking one, the jacfruit tree, with large, rough-looking shuck,
is also a product of the soil. Down in the valley the pale-green
paddies will be found, the rice growing in a foot of water.
Into another tunnel the train suddenly disappears, and an upward
grade is traveled, when short, stubby rows of tea bushes
appear. Then, looking to the right, rise mountains to a
height of 2,000 feet. On another side natives may be seen
in a large grove, with small tin cups in their hands, devoting
their time to the trees; these are rubber-tree tappers and sap
collectors. The air has now become clearer and cooler than
the humid atmosphere of Colombo. Along the roads that parallel
the railway track may be seen a light wagon, or trap, with
two fast-stepping bullocks hitched to the vehicle. These are
known as "trotting bullocks," and are the fastest means of
passenger transportation away from the more populous centers.
All landscape scenes and vistas on the route from Colombo to
Kandy are luxuriantly tropical.</p>

<p>Kandy has a population of 25,000, but if the same place were
located in Europe or in the United States, considering its attractiveness,
half a million people would occupy one-story
bungalows on the verdure-drooping hillsides and the pretty
valley would be lined by homes of wealthy people far beyond
the limited space now built upon. Splendid roadways and
paths, embowered with tropical leaves, have been cut into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
hillsides, and from these one looks down on a pretty lake in the
valley. When the beauty and attractiveness of places cannot
be truly portrayed by modern photographic appliances, it is
difficult to reflect their characteristics with the pen. The altitude
of Kandy is nearly 2,000 feet above sea-level, which insures
a better atmosphere than is usually found on the coast in tropical
climes.</p>

<p>Kandy was the capital of what was known as the Kandy
Kingdom, and was subjected to attacks by both the Portuguese
and Dutch from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, when
England added that section of Ceylon to her possessions, in
1815.</p>

<p>Buddha's tooth and other sacred Hindu relics having been
brought to Kandy at an earlier date was the means of bringing
that pretty place in Ceylon to the fore. It has not been
made clear whether Buddha had but one molar or a full set,
but the inference is that he had but one tooth, as the sacred
bone is referred to as Buddha's tooth. There is no question
about Buddha having been quite a traveler, as the imprints of
his foot will be shown visitors at places separated by many
hundreds of miles. And in connection with the foot imprint,
it is always designated as Buddha's foot, so, if the one-tooth
theory is to be entertained, his having but one foot, or one leg,
would be equally as tenable. The tooth, anyway, like the
Koh-i-Noor diamond, was considered a treasure, and for that
precious reason it had been stolen on several occasions, but the
original molar seems to have got lost, or some one is secreting
it until the price of that particular bone advances to a fabulous
figure. But the Hindus of Ceylon had to have a Buddha
tooth, so an imitation "grinder" was made&mdash;a piece of discolored
ivory two inches long and about an inch in diameter,
which looks more like a crocodile's tooth than that of a man.
The sacred tooth is said to repose now under a golden lotus
flower, and the flower is hidden by seven metal shrines containing
jewels in a sacred building in the courtyard of Maligawa
Temple. In front of the temple is a tank containing tortoises,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
from whose "coverings," perhaps, the Singhalese will make
haircombs later.</p>

<p>Taking a short trip from Kandy, a river was reached, and the
ferry boat was slowly pulled from one side to the other by men
with ropes. The boat was crowded with ox teams and almost
naked natives. A short distance from the ferry landing seven
elephants were seen bathing in the river. Continuing along a
tropical overgrown road, at a bend we were confronted with
three elephants in charge of mahouts, each carrying by its teeth
four sacks of copra. A rope had been placed around the center
of the bags, was pulled tight, and a short end of it was held by
the elephants' grinders. The products were being brought to
the ferry by the big beasts, and oxen would then draw this to
Kandy, the nearest railroad center. By the same means tea and
other products are transported, and provisions from Kandy are
delivered at the other side of the river, from which point elephants
advance the wares beyond. The elephants are owned
by an heir of the old Kandy rulers, and on certain holidays they
are brought to the city, when they parade about the former
capital fifteen times.</p>

<p>Women standing in water nearly to their knees were engaged
at transplanting rice stalks in paddies. The paddies, or beds,
which are banked with earth from 6 to 12 inches on all sides
to retain water, range in area from a space six feet square to
a plot containing acres. In these the rice is sown, and when the
stalks have grown to about a foot high most of them are transplanted.
In some parts of the paddy the rice will be too thickly
sowed, and in other sections not thick enough. The stalks in
the thickets will then be pulled out, those left being the regular
growth. The surplus stalks will next be transplanted in thinly
sowed places of the bed. By this means the paddy would be
equally sown; and it was interesting to observe the alertness
with which the work progressed. At a place in India a dozen
men were seen baling water from a ditch into a paddy with
their hands, illustrating the crude methods in use. Rice is the
staple food of natives in Ceylon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>In both India and Ceylon one never sees a woman servant
engaged at housework in European homes or hotels. Men are
exclusively employed at this occupation, women doing the harder
work in the fields, carrying water, bricks, etc.</p>

<p>The Royal Botanical Garden, located a few miles from
Kandy, was the most interesting one seen. We had visited the
clove groves at Zanzibar, and specimens were growing in the
Kandy garden, but we had not seen the nutmeg tree before.
The nutmeg grows on a tree as large as the buckeye, or horse
chestnut, and is of the same nature, differing in one respect,
however, the nutmeg being protected by an inner shuck. It
falls from the tree, when the outer shuck cracks, but is protected
by the inner or second covering. It is then the size and
color of a pink peach, but when the second shuck has been removed
the nutmeg of commerce is seen. The vanilla bean hung
from vines in the garden; the pepper vine was seen among the
plants growing; the sago palm grew there, also the "candlestick"
tree, besides other rare growths. Some of the larger
trees in this garden were bare of leaves, which tropical oddity
was accounted for by the presence of flying foxes&mdash;the same
as those mentioned in Leg Four&mdash;hanging by the claws of one
leg from the limbs during the day. There were thousands of
these large bats, and, as in Tonga, they were considered sacred,
and no one would kill them.</p>

<p>In this part of Ceylon most of the land was under tea cultivation.
Tea exports from the island are nearly 190,000,000
pounds a year.</p>

<p>While oxen are the means of transportation in both India
and Ceylon, automobiles may be seen skimming about the good
roads in both countries.</p>

<p>A return was made to Colombo, where a ship, on which passage
had been engaged, was about due to leave that port. I
had sailed on English, Swedish and German vessels till I had
reached Bombay; but from Colombo I started east on a Japanese
ship.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing passengers refer to incidents that took place aboard
ship "three weeks ago" sounded far-fetched in these days of
speedy travel, yet those on this Japanese ship had been at sea
over four weeks when the vessel sailed from Colombo on her
Far Eastern voyage. The European passengers were nearly
all English, and not a single American was met with. Some
Japanese and Chinese were traveling second-class, but Europeans
were assigned certain tables and the "yellow" men
had tables to themselves. Steamship fare is reasonable for long
voyages, but the fare from intermediate ports in this section of
the world is expensive. The ship was loaded to the water-line
with cargo, and every berth was occupied. The deck was covered
with a double canvas as we traveled through a tropical
sun over the Indian Ocean. Some of the passengers were going
to Siam and Cochin-China, others to the Federated Malay
States, a few to Borneo, and a number to Java; also others
bound for Hongkong, Manila, and Shanghai, the southern Japanese
ports, and the remainder for Yokohama, Japan, the last
stop. The voyage was from Antwerp, Belgium, to Yokohama,
a nine weeks' journey.</p>

<p>Until recently marine insurance companies would not take
any risk with Japanese-manned ships, for which reason the merchant
fleet of Japan had been under the direction of British
captains and chief engineers. In order that Japanese could
command Japanese ships, examinations for the position of captain
or chief engineer was made more severe than that required
by other countries. By this means the services of British officers
are gradually being dispensed with, insurance companies
now recognizing the efficiency of Japanese navigators.</p>

<p>Three days out from Colombo land was seen to the south&mdash;Sumatra,
a Dutch possession, where the natives cause much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
trouble. Entering the Straits of Malacca, bounded on the
north by the Malay Peninsula and on the south by Sumatra,
for 500 miles&mdash;the length of the Straits&mdash;we sailed in sight
of land. (The Indian Ocean had been crossed and recrossed
on the trip to Australia and back to South Africa, then to
Mombasa and over to Bombay.) We have now left the Straits
and the Indian Ocean, and the ship is sailing through an island-dotted
stretch of sea; a city appears ahead&mdash;Singapore, the
maritime junction of the Far East.</p>

<p>What a difference in the condition of the people in this city
to those seen in India and Ceylon! None looked starved, there
were no deformed people, no beggars, and the natives were
tidier and better dressed. The native Malay is much lighter in
color than the Indian and Singhalese. Though the Malay is
the native of Singapore, Chinese far outnumber them or any
other race.</p>

<p>The business section of Singapore is as flat as the Indian
plains, and when a heavy shower of rain falls some of the streets
are under water two feet. The population of the Straits Settlements
metropolis is over 300,000 and, as in India, there is no
sewerage in the city. The streets in the native and Chinese
quarters were better looked after than those in Indian cities in
similar sections. Some of the business buildings are good and
substantial, with elevators in the larger structures. Many of
the sidewalks are covered by balconies to buildings in the business
district, which is accounted for by the hot weather in that
section the year round, Singapore being located 80 miles north
of the equator.</p>

<p>All vessels sailing in that part of the world stop at Singapore&mdash;those
going to Java, Borneo, Siam, Cochin-China, south or
north of the Philippine group, and vessels that continue to China
and Japan. Some vessels go no further east than Singapore,
and again start from that point west.</p>

<p>The Straits Settlements comprise the island of Singapore, the
Province of Malacca and a number of other islands in that district.
The Federated Malay States are embraced in the Malay
Peninsula, all of which is under British rule. The governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
the Straits Settlements also has jurisdiction over the Federated
States. The city of Singapore was selected as an English settlement
by Stamford Raffles in 1819, at that time a small native
colony. Singapore island is 28 miles long and 14 miles wide.</p>

<p>Irish potatoes do not grow in that section, and one seldom
has fresh milk, condensed milk being the lacteal generally used
in many sections of the tropics. It looked strange to see a big
ship unloading for days cases containing tins of milk, brought
from Europe, to a country where grass is always green.</p>

<p>Thousands of acres of Singapore Island are under pineapple
cultivation, and large quantities of that fruit are shipped from
this port. The bountiful yield of this product has been brought
about almost entirely through the industriousness of Chinese.</p>

<p>Passing a cocoanut grove, trees, almost uprooted, will be seen
lying flat on the ground, the fronds being as fresh and green as
those standing. Nothing can inspire hope so much as the cocoanut
palm. It is often blown down by storms, twisted and
wrecked, but as long as there is left even a thread of root the
palm will continue to grow. As soon as it has recovered from
the shock, so to speak, the bushy top that had been flattened on
the earth from the fall will be seen pointing upward. Pass the
same dethroned palm later, and the fronds will be found to be
in a direct line with the rays of the sun at midday. Under any
adversity its head will be pointed straight upward. A large
tonnage of copra is also shipped from this port, there being
extensive cocoanut plantations on Singapore and adjacent islands.</p>

<p>This part of the world is rubber mad. Rubber grows in
some sections of the Federated States better than anywhere else.
Questionable rubber companies operate here, however, stock
being issued and dealt in, after which the "sharpers" get
aboard-ship and disappear. As much as 400 pounds of rubber
an acre is gathered yearly, the price running from $3 to $4 a
pound. Much of the tin used in the world is mined in this
district, which, with rubber, are also staple exports from this
port.</p>

<p>The currency of the Straits Settlements is the dollar, which
in that country equals 56 American cents; small coins are also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
termed cents. Straits Settlements paper money&mdash;one-dollar,
five-dollar bills, etc.&mdash;is the dirtiest met with. The color of
the bills is dark green, and they are so soiled that it is often
difficult to see the denomination on the face.</p>

<p>Hotel rates were higher here than we had been charged since
leaving Johannesburg. The cheapest accommodation in the city
was $5 a day ($2.80 in American money). In Australasia
hotel expenses did not exceed $1.50 a day, and in India and
Ceylon the same sum was not exceeded. Singapore is what is
termed a free port, which makes high hotel rates even more
difficult to understand. Articles generally were more costly
than in countries visited which levy a heavy import tariff.</p>

<p>A winter tourist ship stopped here which had among its
passengers a greater number of Americans than of any other
nationality. A dinner was served at the best hotel in the city,
and a goodly stock of wine and liquors had been provided for
the occasion. To the surprise of the boniface, most of the passengers
asked for ice water when eating. The small sum the
tourists spent for liquids caused a general laugh in that city.</p>

<p>"Stengha," a word that sounds like "stinger," is spoken to
a waiter when ordering refreshments. Few persons living in
the hot countries drink water, so whisky and soda is very apt
to be a "stengha."</p>

<p>Some sections of Singapore are well shaded, and the streets
are good. Recreation grounds are very good, and churches
are seen at every turn. In addition, there is an interesting
museum, and a short distance from the city is located an attractive
botanical garden. Rickshas are numerous, drawn by
Chinese, and the fare is reasonable. No one walks in Singapore.
To offset the glare of the sun, some of the sidewalks
have been covered with red soil. A good street-car system has
been installed, and the place is lighted by electricity.</p>

<p>A load of live hogs, drawn by oxen yoked to a two-wheeled
cart and driven by a Chinaman, passed along a street. Each
hog was encased in a bamboo basket or barrel, with grass rope
tied across the opening to keep the porker from getting out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
his "stall." There were ten hogs to the load, stacked one on
top of the other.</p>

<p>A large number of wealthy Chinese live in the Straits Settlements.
When traveling through the islands there may be
seen, carved on the posts of large entrance gates of the Mongols'
homes, peacocks, lions, birds, and fantastic, hideous-looking
figures. These residents may be seen any time of day or evening
riding about the city and island in modern and sumptuous
motor-cars.</p>

<p>Some years ago a young American diplomat had been appointed
consul at Bangkok, Siam. A merchant of the Siamese
capital owed an American a large sum of money. Through the
young consul the American sought to recover the debt, whereupon
the diplomat threatened the Siamese merchant with the
power of America. An American battleship later anchored in
Singapore harbor. Down from Siam came the young and ardent
consul, with but one aim in view&mdash;to persuade the captain
of the battleship to proceed to Bangkok with his vessel and
scare the money out of the debtor. The captain told the consul
he had no objection to doing so if he (the consul) would
cable the War Department at Washington, D. C., for instructions
to that effect. A cable was sent immediately, and a reply
soon received, which read: "Explain why you are absent from
your post of duty." The consul walked floors, fearing recall,
and had to write several letters to the State Department before
he could entertain hope of retaining his post.</p>

<p>What looks like a round bolster is found at the foot of every
bed. This equipment is to put under the body, to allow air
to pass between the body and mattress, as the nights are very
hot. In other ways the bolster is used to protect the flesh.
This article of utility is called a "Dutch wife."</p>

<p>In the government printing office in Singapore were 150
printers, and out of that number there was but one white man,
the overseer. The wages were $10 to $14 a month, which was
$3 to $5 a month more than was paid in India for similar work.
There is much room for improvement in the Singapore offices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
although the hours worked are but seven a day, the business
hours of that city.</p>

<p>Every one has his "boy" servant in Singapore. While getting
money at a bank the clerk had a "boy" to blot any writing
he (the clerk) did. Unmarried men often eat their meals
in their room, which are brought from the kitchen by a "boy"
servant. Many have a ricksha puller for their own use.
Single men often have as many as three servants.</p>

<p>Malaria and other tropical fevers impair the health of many
settlers. The heavy rainfall, hot sun, and low-lying land account
for the absence of fat men in that section of the world.</p>

<p>Every one wears white clothes and helmet. Starched or
dress shirts are little worn. A high collar is attached to the
white jacket, and under the jacket is generally worn a thin
woolen undershirt.</p>

<p>As in India, one seldom sees a white child here. As soon as
children become able to run about they are sent to Europe to be
educated and to acquire a sound constitution. Nearly all the
Europeans living in the Straits Settlements and Federated States
are Britishers.</p>

<p>A great many Chinese find employment in carrying small
restaurants about the city on split bamboo poles. They shout
as they travel along, and stop when a customer indicates that he
wants to eat. Chopsticks are used in lieu of knife and fork.
"Makan" is the Malays' word for food. The Malay language
is spoken by all classes. The native is not burdened
with energy, the prosperous condition of that country having
been brought about mainly by Chinamen.</p>

<p>Singapore holds ninth place in the principal shipping ports
of the world, the harbor being crowded with large and small
craft.</p>

<p>An effort was made to travel direct from Singapore to Manila,
but, after waiting two weeks for a ship going to the
Philippines' capital, the plan was abandoned. A start was then
made for Hongkong on a German ship. Like the Japanese
vessel that had brought me to Singapore from Colombo, the
German ship was weighed down to the water-line with cargo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
every berth in the cabins being occupied. The distance from
Singapore to Hongkong is 1,440 miles, and the fare, second-class,
was $31.50.</p>

<p>Seeing a drawling American on this ship, a Britisher sized
him up as one who might be twitted. "What is your business,
may I ask?" began the Britisher. "Oh! I generally follow
mining," drawled the "Yank." "Is there much money in it?"
asked the Britisher. "Oh, the usual thing in mining&mdash;chicken
one day and feathers the next," sluggishly answered the
American. "By the way," said the "Yank," perking up, "may
I ask what your business is?" "Oh, I'm a missionary,"
promptly answered John Bull's subject. "Is there much money
in it?" whipped back the "Yankee."</p>

<p>For two days out from Singapore the German ship rode the
seas as smoothly as a motor-car running over a well-tarred
road. Then the weather grew stormy and the ocean rough.
We had entered the China Sea. The time of year was the day
before Christmas, and a Christmas tree had been erected in the
dining saloon, ornamented with bright-colored tinsel balls, chocolate
bars wrapped in tinfoil, colored candy hatchets, lions,
dogs and dolls; sprigs of holly with red berries, rosy red apples
hanging from bending boughs, candy wrapped in vari-colored
and fringed papers, wax candles hanging from limbs, with
medicated cotton and white powder scattered over the pine tree
to indicate snow. The sea had become rougher, and the steady
ship of a few days earlier was now rolling and pitching her
heavy tonnage against powerful waves, the propellers often revolving
in unwatered space. Few had interest in the tree this
Christmas Eve, as most of the passengers had become seasick.
As a result, and the storm not having abated, only half a dozen
of the big list of passengers ate turkey with cranberry sauce,
mince pie, raisins, and nuts that Christmas Day while sailing
over the China Sea. The day following the sea became quieter,
and an island came in view, then more islands. The sea having
calmed, passengers became numerous on deck. Buildings,
on the side of a high, green island, were now seen&mdash;we had
reached the island of Hongkong, China. As the vessel neared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the harbor, the city, resting comfortably at the base of the
mountain and stretching along the shore, was clearly outlined.
Being our initial visit to a Chinese city, Johnson's lines came to
mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Let observation, with extensive view,</p>
<p>Survey mankind from China to Peru."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Ho! There was an American flag flying from the mast of
a ship at anchor in the harbor&mdash;the fourth time the United
States emblem was seen waving from a ship's mast during a
journey of over 60,000 miles, most of which was by water.
At Dunedin, N. Z., the first flag was seen flying from a dilapidated
schooner, and the other two from small vessels at Apia,
Samoa.</p>

<p>Hongkong is a horseless and oxless town. This island city
is far up in the list of ports&mdash;perhaps fourth&mdash;and it is difficult
to believe that the cargo of great vessels could be moved
almost entirely by human aid alone; yet such is the fact. There
would seem to be no obstacles that the Chinaman cannot surmount.
On a split bamboo pole Chinamen have been known
to carry 500 pounds' weight. Generally, what one man cannot
carry two will; but any weight too much for two would
be moved along by four Chinese, two at each end of a bamboo
pole. Heavy loads that cannot be moved by poles are placed
on to a two-wheeled hand truck. India and Ceylon looked unprogressive
with the two-wheeled ox carts, but when one reaches
an important seaport city and finds neither mules, horses, oxen
or donkeys to move heavy traffic, that feature must be classed
among the world's oddities.</p>

<p>The mountain behind the city rises to a height of nearly
2,000 feet. Buildings have been built on the mountainside,
and on the summit stand the barracks, or fort, and the Governor-General's
residence. Some of these buildings, used for
hospitals and other purposes, are big; yet every brick, stone,
pound of mortar, furniture&mdash;everything of which the buildings
and fort are made&mdash;had been carried up the roads and footpaths
cut in the sides of the mountain on the backs, shoulders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
or heads of Chinese, mostly women. A cable railway runs
from nearly the bottom to the top, but the company that built
the line is forbidden to carry other than passengers up the
slope. That restriction was placed on the company in order
that the Chinese would not be deprived of work necessitated
by the demand for supplies and provisions by those living in that
section of Hongkong Island.</p>

<p>The city appears on maps as the City of Victoria, but Hongkong
is the only name one hears. The island comprises an
area of 29 square miles, and was ceded to Great Britain in
1843. But England has acquired an additional area of 380
square miles on the mainland opposite. The city has a population
of 300,000, but half a million inhabitants reside on the
island. Of this number 6,000 are Europeans, the remainder
largely Chinese. The water channel separating Hongkong
from the mainland is a mile wide, and opposite the city is
Kowloon, where large vessels put in at wharves and from which
place the railway starts for Canton.</p>

<p>Hongkong is reputed to have the most picturesque setting of
any city in the world, and the view seemed better than that
offered by Capetown, South Africa. A perpetually green mountain
rises steeply nearly 2,000 feet from the seashore, and the
splendid roads and walks cut in the sides might, seen from a
distance, resemble the threads on a mammoth screw. White
brick buildings, covered with red-tile roofing, rise from the
verdured sides at frequent intervals. This attractiveness continues
to the summit, which is capped, as it were, with the
official residence and forts. From the summit the view seems
superior to that from below, as the ornamentation of the steep
slope, both by nature and man, with the city at the base, ships
lolling at anchor in the harbor and pretty islands dotting the
haven from three sides, all unite in maintaining the reputation
the island bears.</p>

<p>A boycott was issued by the Chinese against the street railway
system of Hongkong. The trouble came about through
the railway company refusing to accept Canton money for fares
on the cars, and the boycott resulted. The cars ran back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
forth without Chinese passengers during the period of the
strike.</p>

<p>Sedan chairs are the means of conveyance for people living
on the mountainside. The chair is box-shape with a seat, fastened
to two long bamboo poles. The passenger steps in, a
Chinaman between the poles at each end, and grunts are heard
while raising the poles to their shoulders. Off they start up the
steep incline, no matter whether the passenger be light or heavy,
with as apparent ease as if a chicken were inside the box. The
charge for a long ride is 15 to 25 cents, divided between the
Chinamen. Rickshas are the conveyances used in the city. A
short ride costs three cents, and if hired by the hour the charge
is 15 cents. The rickshas in Hongkong, Colombo, and Singapore
are made to carry but one person, while the sulkies drawn
by the Zulus in Durban, South Africa, are built to hold two
persons. Zulus go as fast and as far with two fares as the
pullers of other countries do with one passenger. Both chair
carriers and ricksha pullers are in their bare feet.</p>

<p>Hongkong is very substantially built, and it is doubtful if
there is a frame house on the island. No one who has not seen
that city would expect to find the splendid business blocks that
so creditably adorn the place. Some of these are seven and
eight stories high. Most of the sidewalks are covered with
cement roofing, giving the walks a half-arcade appearance,
which is done when erecting buildings, as the sun is hot in
summer.</p>

<p>Porcelain bath tubs and running hot water were found in
Hongkong, the first we noted since leaving South Africa. In
British-East Africa, Uganda, India, Ceylon, and Singapore
round wooden tubs were in use, and hot water was carried to
the bath room by servants.</p>

<p>The water-front of Hongkong was crowded with crudely
designed boats, called sampans. The craft has a mast, and
when in use sails&mdash;sometimes made of reeds&mdash;are pulled to
the breeze. The quaint craft has a cabin, and large families
are born and reared on board, it being their home. A large
oar at the stern, rolled from one side to the other when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
craft is moving, helps to advance the sampan and acts as a
rudder besides; it has two oars at the sides also. In most cases
the craft is manned by women and their children. Frequently
a Chinese woman, who looks like a hunchback, is seen pulling
an oar. The apparent deformity proves to be a delusion, however,
as, when she has reached shore and secured the sampan,
she unwraps a cloth and a ruddy-faced baby rolls into her arms.
What would be a heavy burden to women of other races a
Chinese woman does not seem to mind.</p>

<p>The Hongkong policeman is unique. He wears a bright,
yellow-colored helmet, a jacket with brass buttons, knickerbockers,
white leggings, and the scow-shaped Chinese shoes.
His bearing is decidedly military, and he is unassuming when
on duty. The Indian Sikh is also employed for police duty,
but is not so interesting as the native.</p>

<p>Daily English newspapers are published in Hongkong, and
linotype machines are in use in some offices. In one place a
Chinese linotype operator could not speak a word of English,
yet he could read English copy and set a clean proof. The
wage paid was $15 a month. Europeans were in charge of the
printing departments, but the mechanics were Chinese.</p>

<p>Mock Duck, Duck Mock, Fat Duck, Duck Fat, Wa Duck,
Ho Duck were common names observed on signs above the
doors of business houses in Hongkong.</p>

<p>Chinamen seem to be eating most of the time, the portable
restaurant, as in Singapore, being in use here. Their food
appeared to be mostly fish, vegetables, and what looked like
spaghetti, and tea was drunk at eating-time. As all eat with
chopsticks, table cutlery is little in demand among the natives.
"Chou" is their name for food.</p>

<p>The dollar is the unit of money in Hongkong, but its value
is much lower than the Straits Settlements dollar, being that of
the Mexican dollar, which varies from 44 to 50 cents. Fractional
coins are on the cent basis, and are made of silver, nickel,
and copper.</p>

<p>When visiting a bank in Hongkong, hundreds of natives were
seen at the rear, with a clerk shouting something in Chinese.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Inquiry as to what occasioned so large a number of visitors at
the bank, brought forth the information "They had just come
from America and were having checks cashed." Every nation
takes money out of America, the feeding ground of the world.</p>

<p>There is a large photograph gallery, or archive, in the American
consulate in Hongkong, which contains the portrait of
every Chinaman who has been to America and returned to
China.</p>

<p>A good botanical garden is located just above the business
center of the city, and parks, good public buildings, a museum,
libraries, churches and schools, and other public features are well
represented.</p>

<p>Mail from Europe will be longer traveling to Hongkong
than to any other port in the world, and vice versa. From
centers north of Hongkong mail is sent by way of Siberia, and
the larger amount of mail even from this city is, perhaps,
carried over the Siberian railway. Were one, however, to mail
a letter in London, Paris, or Berlin to Hongkong, by way of
the Suez Canal&mdash;the main route from Europe to the Far East&mdash;it
would not reach the Chinese port earlier than six weeks'
time from date of mailing. From 40 days to six weeks is the
regular time required for passenger ships to travel from Europe
to Hongkong.</p>

<p>Hotel expenses were cheaper than at Singapore, being only
two dollars a day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>A trip was made up the West River to Canton, a stretch of
water in which vessels are sometimes sacked by Chinese pirates.
A half-dozen or more of these daring Mongols will board a
boat at the starting place as passengers did, and when an opportunity
offers they will overpower the officers, when the
ship will be at their mercy. Not long ago an effective weapon
called "stinkpot" was in use. These bad smelling crocks
were thrown about the decks of a boat, bursting, and the nauseating
odor from them would partly suffocate any who happened
to be near. The pirates well knew where to burst them to the
best advantage. To prevent successful piratical attacks to river
craft, English gunboats have been stationed at certain places of
this large river. Hongkong is the port for Canton and the
great population in Southern China, and no one who has not
taken a sail up that river can form a correct idea of the large
number of people who crowd on the boats, particularly in the
third-class section.</p>

<p>When the boat reaches Canton, and before it is alongside
the wharf, Chinese, emerging from rowboats, will be seen scaling
the sides of the vessel from stem to stern with the agility of
monkeys. In a very short time they throw their legs across the
deck rails, every one of them on the alert to earn a few cents
by carrying a valise, directing a passenger to his ricksha or
sedan chair, or presenting to the visitors business cards of silk,
damascene, ivory, or other merchants. Guides are also much
in evidence, and if there is any city in the world where a guide
is needed it is surely Canton, China.</p>

<p>Soon we are in a sedan chair&mdash;the only means, except afoot,
of getting about the city&mdash;with a Chinaman at each end, the
poles resting on their shoulders. The guide was in front, and
in a short time we had passed through an entrance in the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
wall. All was different then, and it is doubtful if a stranger
could find his way out after having gone not more than two
city squares in Canton. The streets are from three to fifteen
feet wide, and boxes, tubs, tanks and pails, used by storekeepers
to show their goods, encroach even on this limited space.
Were one to go to a large ant-hill on a hot day, when the insects
are thick and moving about quickly, the mound would
afford a fair illustration of Canton within the walls. The
city is one great human ant-hill. We had been through the
teeming streets of the native quarters of some Indian cities,
and concluded there could not be more density of population
anywhere, but that opinion soon changed after stepping inside
the walls of the metropolis of Southern China. Any one who
has visited Hongkong and thinks he has seen a typical Chinese
city would do well to pay a visit to Canton.</p>

<p>"Hey-ho, ho-hey, yay-he-ho, ho-ye-hay," sounds something
like what a Chinaman sings or chants to make known his
coming in the human-packed streets. Bear in mind, there is
neither horse, ox, mule, nor ricksha puller traversing the streets&mdash;only
men and women, with loads carried on split bamboo
poles. They all have a song, grunt or yawn to give warning
of their coming. Some of the streets are so narrow that two
sedan chairs, carried in opposite directions, cannot pass. On
such occasions the carriers of one chair must stop until the others
squeeze their way between the wall of a store and the people,
who are constantly passing to and fro. It is natural, when
carrying burdens on poles, to have poles resting on both shoulders,
but the crowded streets here will not permit of that.
The load has to be carried on one shoulder, the pole pointing
in front. While the narrow streets and teeming crowds make
it much harder for men to bear loads in that manner, how
much more inconvenient it must be for a woman carrying the
same weight, with a baby tied to her back! There appeared
to be as many women as men with the weight-carrying poles
over their shoulders, and with both sexes coolie custom seemed
to forbid walking, as all moved at a trot when space permitted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p>Roasted pork, dried fish, and dried fowl were much in evidence
in the shops; and for long distances wooden tubs containing
water and live fish line a street. Butcher shops and vegetable
stores are also seen at every turn. Garbage from each
store or dwelling is placed in the street, and this is often kicked
about before the garbage man takes it away. Hydrants are
numerous, and lines of people wait their turn to get water.
Wide boards, on which are written Chinese characters, often
meet from each side, and a reed covering placed above, and
extending across the street, drawn by ropes, shades people from
the sun. Between the grunts, yawns, and songs of the laborers,
together with the general conversation and the shouts from
others at intruders on the dried fish and fowl, it is dampness,
noise, stench and jam from the time one enters until he emerges
outside the wall. In this large city there is no sewerage.</p>

<p>The street paving is composed of stones from two to three
feet wide, and in length the width of the street. As there are
neither horses nor wagons used in the city, most of the people
in their bare feet, and, as the sandals worn by others have soft
soles, the pavement lasts a long time, although some of the
thick stones show signs of wear from the millions of feet passing
over them. Between the broad signs, other signs printed on
wide strips of canvas, together with the curtains that cover the
thoroughfares above the cramped space, the streets of Canton
resemble tunnels more than anything else.</p>

<p>The City of the Dead, a burying place in Canton, differed
from any before seen. The coffins are logs, hewed out for a
body, are of cylindrical shape, with four corners, and appear as
if four pieces of lumber had been sealed together. The top
quarter-piece is loose and serves as the lid. Some of these odd-appearing
coffins are expensive, as they are heavily inlaid with
mother-of-pearl and gold leaf. The first resting-place consists
of two rooms, and these are separated by a matting curtain. In
the second, or inside, chamber the coffin rests on two supports
as large as a washtub. In the outer, or reception chamber,
stands a table with flowers, an incense-stick pot, and a glass
containing oil, with a wick. The incense-stick was burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
and the wick was casting a dim flame. Every morning and
afternoon a fresh cup of tea is placed on the stand, together
with fruit and fresh flowers. The light was kept burning
so the spirit of the dead could find its way about, and, if
it felt like eating, the food was ready. The corpse rests in
that place for six months, when the remains are removed to a
permanent burial ground and put under the earth. The temporary&mdash;or
six months'&mdash;resting place rents for $10 a month,
or $60 for the time allowed. Formerly the corpse remained in
these lying-in-state, or ancestral halls, for years, but that has
been changed to a six months' period. Only well-to-do Chinese
are so laid to rest.</p>

<p>The wall encircling Canton is six miles round, but the city
has outgrown the old lines. At one place, just inside the wall,
is the old execution ground, where offenders against the law
were beheaded, but it is now used as a pottery.</p>

<p>A hundred and twenty-four temples of the Confucius and
Buddhist faiths were found here, but, when visiting some of
these, the growing grass, dilapidated walks, dusty images, and
general lack of care in evidence at every turn suggested that
the Chinaman has broken loose from old religious moorings.
In the Geneii Temple were 500 figures on one side of the
building, badly in need of dusting. A very good pagoda, five
stories high, is a feature of Canton. All the pagodas of China
are of odd stories&mdash;three, five or seven.</p>

<p>The various manufacturing industries of the city are situated
in one quarter. A big business is done in jadestone, mostly
made into rings, and used as bracelets; but the stone is used also
for other ornaments. The jadestone industry is situated in a
certain district; furniture manufacturing is also centralized; the
mother-of-pearl workers are located in still another section;
this applies also to the ivory, damascene, jewelry, and tinware
industries. Little or no machinery is used, most of the work
being done by hand.</p>

<p>The city seemed to be free of loafers, everybody doing something.
Talking with a Chinese acquaintance on this point, he
stated that the only men out of work were gamblers, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
"occupation" had been taken from them by official decree.
They had never learned to do anything else. The opium houses
had also been closed. Not a queue was seen hanging down the
back of the males one met, the cutting off of the pigtails being
in compliance with a government edict. The hair from the
queues was shipped to other countries.</p>

<p>"Sweating money" is a custom said to be much practiced in
China. Gold coins are placed in a sheet or cloth, which is
then vigorously shaken. The coins, clashing against each other,
wear off the milling, which remains in the sheet. When the
coins are "sweated" to the satisfaction of the "sweaters" the
cloth is put in a kettle or retort, when the gold dust, or milling,
remains at the bottom. It is owing to this "sweating" process
that, when gold is required in transactions of fifty dollars and
much greater sums, bankers often determine the value of the
metal by weighing it rather than by accepting the coins at their
face value.</p>

<p>Concerning the population of Canton, there seemed to be no
official figures. Some give the number at a million, others at
two millions, and even three millions of people are said to be
residents of the metropolis of Southern China. Statements of
the Pearl River population, however, seem to be authentic.
Just think of half a million people living on the water! The
river is partly blocked with native craft&mdash;sampans&mdash;and
these are the homes of people numbering as many as comprise
the city of Baltimore, Md. Each owner of a sampan pays a
small license fee to the city; but they have no water rent to pay
or house rent bills. The sampan is the home of a great many
Chinese from birth until they die, generally at a ripe old age.
The Pearl River is called the West River at Hongkong.</p>

<p>Missionaries living in the interior have enough bread baked
at one baking to last them a month. The bread is sliced, then
toasted, and taken to the mission. Toasting the bread keeps it
from getting mouldy.</p>

<p>An island, separated by a fork of the Pearl River, is known as
the Shameen, and here the few Europeans of Canton reside.
The Shameen has been leased from China by both France and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
England for a term of 99 years. The area of the concession
is but 69 acres, and 300 Europeans make their home in that
pretty place. The consulates of other European countries also
are located on the island, and the only European hotel in Canton
is among the few modern buildings seen in the old Chinese
city. Two bridges span the branch of water that forms the
island on the city side, and high, strong gates are located at each
end of these bridges. The approaches to the Shameen are
guarded by policemen day and night, and Chinese not employed
by residents of that district, or who have no business to attend to
on the island, are not allowed to cross the bridges. The gates
are opened at 6 o'clock in the morning, and are closed at 9
o'clock in the evening. Native servants or employees having occasion
to go out after dark must carry a light, and among these
one sees some odd designs. A small lantern but little larger
than a goose egg will be carried by one Chinaman, another will
be seen with a light burning in what looks like a soup bowl,
the regular European lantern will be carried by another, and
the square, colored-paper Chinese lantern will be lighting the
way of still another native. A Chinaman has no right to live
in the Shameen; those who do live on the island are there by
sufferance of the two powers who leased the land.</p>

<p>The homes and business buildings of Canton do not exceed
three stories, most of them but one or two stories in height.
The doors are heavy, and iron bars protect some of the windows.
Brick, stone, and mortar are the material used in construction,
with black tiling for roofs. A marked air of privacy pervades
the exterior of Chinese homes.</p>

<p>Stones, pear-shaped, are used as seats by the Chinese. These
may be seen in tea gardens and places of quiet recreation. This
custom of using stones as seats is because they are cooler than
any other material. Occupants sit astride the stones.</p>

<p>Canton, the capital of the Province of Kwangtung, is styled
the "City of Rams" from the legend of the five immortals who
rode into the city on the backs of five rams during the Chow
dynasty, which ruled from 1112-255 B. C. The metropolis
was made a treaty port in 1842.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Two kinds of dollars are in use&mdash;the Hongkong and the
Kwangtung&mdash;the former in the Shameen and the latter in the
city and province. The Hongkong dollar is worth more than
the Kwangtung, as the former is backed by England and the
other by the present unsettled China. The cheapest hotel rate
was $4 a day, and only Hongkong money was accepted in payment.</p>

<p>First-, second- and third-class cars are used on the railway line
running from Kowloon to Canton. The first-class coaches are
of European style&mdash;compartments&mdash;and the second- and third-class
cars are open, with an aisle and seats on both sides, like
the American cars, but without cushions. The fare for first-class
travel was six cents a mile, and three cents for second-class
accommodation. The water pirates, like hippopotami
on a foraging expedition, sometimes take a stroll from their
river haunts and succeed in plundering the passengers of the
railway train. Along the line could be seen small, level
patches of ground, not over four feet in length in some instances,
banked on a hillside by stones to keep the soil
from washing away, on which grain and vegetables grew. Little
land is allowed to go to waste in China.</p>

<p>Back I went to Hongkong.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>An American ship was boarded at Hongkong for Manila,
P. I., but the vessel had been built in Glasgow, Scotland. The
distance from Hongkong to Manila is 630 miles, and 60 hours'
time is required to sail between the two points. The fare, first-class,
was $25&mdash;four cents a mile for sea travel. One has
little choice anent "class" on these boats, as second-class is
very inferior. First-class accommodation, however, was good.
After two days of rough sailing land was sighted, and next
morning the ship passed through the right channel of Corregidor
Island into Manila harbor. Thirty miles from the entrance is
Manila. After leaving the ship, it was the first time I had been
on American territory for nearly three years.</p>

<p>What a marked difference in the appearance of streets in
Manila to other cities of the Far East. Instead of Chinese or
natives moving merchandise and other wares on split bamboo
sticks or by ox carts, or donkeys drawing two-wheeled vehicles,
large, fat mules and horses were hitched to big, four-wheeled
trucks loaded with heavy wares, together with big motor trucks
taking part in the healthy business scene. Besides, flitting about
the streets were light, neat-appearing, two-wheeled vehicles
drawn by smart-moving ponies. The two-wheeled trap, called
a calesa, is the chief conveyance. The men driving these were
certainly a strange class of "cabbies," for they did not seem to
care whether they secured a fare or not. The calesas, numbering
3,000, are both a handy and a cheap conveyance, the charge
being 20 cents for the first and 15 cents for each additional
hour.</p>

<p>The principal business street is known as the Escolta, and
little can be said in its favor. Most of the business houses are
conducted by Chinese, Indians and Arabs; and a great many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
the buildings are owned by these merchants, who would be
satisfied to do business in a pig pen so long as money came over
the stye. The street is well paved, well policed, and a good
street-car line has been laid in the center. But it is the lop-sided
appearance of the thoroughfare that grates on one. The
sidewalk at the head of the street is eight feet wide, and gets
narrower and narrower until the walking space has been reduced
to eight inches. The Escolta being the Broadway of
Manila, it is well crowded with Filipinos, Chinamen and Americans.
A better street might be substituted for the Escolta, but
that thoroughfare is owned by Chinese.</p>

<p>The only way to make a modern town out of Manila would
be to destroy the relics of Spanish "art" and rebuild on scientific
lines. The best way to accomplish this would be to have
fires started in sections of the city when a tornado is blowing a
gale of 60 miles an hour, the firemen devoting their energies to
protecting people, but not putting a hand to a hose to combat
the ravages of the flames.</p>

<p>A good street-car system courses the city and outlying districts,
but the fare, like the steamship charge, is too high. There
are first-class and second-class cars, and the fare for first-class
is six cents and second-class five cents. The United States and
her colonies are the only territories we have traveled in where a
receipt is not given a passenger for his street car fare.</p>

<p>Manila has few good buildings, in which respect the Philippine
capital differs from cities in British colonies, but after
Manila has been under American control from 50 to 100 years
there will no doubt be a better showing in this respect.</p>

<p>We had reached another place where potatoes do not grow,
where one gets only condensed milk for his coffee, where meat
and flour are imported from Australia, and cabbage, onions,
celery and cauliflower come from other countries; where vaccination
is the first precaution suggested for the preservation of
life; where one is apt to become sick if he drinks water that has
not been boiled; where one dare not, if life should be dear to
him, eat a piece of raw carrot or other vegetable, or even fruit,
that grows near the earth; where every one sleeps under netting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
at night to keep the mosquito from injecting into his system
malaria fever germs, and where one must not forget to keep a
weather-eye out for the bubonic flea. Everything unerringly
suggests that the tropics have been reached.</p>

<p>Doctors say it is not necessary to drink whisky in the Philippines
to ward off disease, but as cooks are liable to forget to
boil the water, few of the old "tropicalians," while in sympathy
with medical oracles, seem to place faith in the mindfulness of
island cooks. Convulsions and consumption are, in order, the
causes from which most people die in Manila. The death rate
per 1,000 of the total population is 39.61.</p>

<p>New Year's eve was celebrated in the usual American style,
with floats on motor-cars and wagons moving about the streets.
On one motor-car was a large barrel, which looked like a
street sprinkler. A white canvas covered the sides and there
was printed on the cloth in large black letters, "Keep off the
water wagon!"</p>

<p>The hours of work are too long in that climate. In most hot
countries the working time does not exceed eight hours a day,
and in other tropical climes seven hours is the rule. But Americans
work nine and ten hours a day.</p>

<p>On the Luneta, an inviting stretch of green sward, located
along the shore of the bay and between the walls of the old city
and a residential section, concerts are given by a good band six
evenings during the week. The entertainments continue for
an hour, from 6 to 7 o'clock, and, judging by the crowds in
attendance, are much appreciated. At these concerts the Filipino
appears at his best, so far as clothes go. He is vain
as a negro in show of clothes, and if European clothes meant
advancement for native races the Filipino would claim first
place. He often appears much neater than the European.</p>

<p>As with most colored races, the Filipinos are ingrates. They
were neglected under Spanish rule, it is safe to presume, and
now, when a stable system of government has been fixed, and
schools, sound money, sewerage, better water, better wages, better
treatment, and a brighter future have been provided, they
still ask, "What is the United States going to do for us?" All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
the governors of the provinces are natives, but the treasurers
of provinces are mostly Americans. This may be changed in
the future, but a return to the former custom&mdash;a white man
to handle the money&mdash;would soon follow, for very good
reasons.</p>

<p>The worst railroad trains ever ridden on were those running
from Manila. I traveled as far as San Fernando, 38 miles
from the capital, and the time required to cover that distance
was 3 hours and 48 minutes. Another trip was made from
Cavite to Manila, 25 miles separating the two points, and two
and a half hours was the time it took to cover that distance.
In both instances the track was level. The ten-ton engine
drawing a train over a two-foot gauge up the Himalaya mountains
made as good time. Third-class fare is too high for poor
natives; two cents a mile is too much. Steamship fare for
coastwise ships is exorbitant. If the owners of railroad
lines and coastwise ship owners do not make money in the
Philippines, it will not be because they do not charge
enough.</p>

<p>Native women walking about smoking big, black cigars do
not look very edifying. They may be seen any time in the
streets, puffing rings of smoke from cigars or cigarettes.</p>

<p>Unlike other countries visited, few of the natives in Manila
were in their bare feet&mdash;even the children wore neat-looking
sandals.</p>

<p>A starched, springy cloth is worn about the neck of the
women, shaped like a horse-collar. The "collar" is tied in
front with a knot, and rests on the shoulders and neck. In
size and design it is larger than a horse-collar, and the women
are constantly touching it, first on one side and next on the
other, to keep it straight or in right position. The "collars"
are sometimes of silk and of varied colors.</p>

<p>Windows without panes of glass are seen here, formed by
upright panels, an inch wide, nailed to a crosspiece three inches
wide, each having four such crosspieces. Intersecting the spaces
made by the panels and crosspieces are smaller pieces of lath,
which form three-inch squares in the window. In these three-inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
squares flat pieces of light-colored seashell are placed, which
admit light, but through which the hot sun cannot penetrate.
The windows do not raise or swing, but slide from side to side,
when closing or opening. Panes of glass are seen occasionally,
but these are often painted a dark color to keep out the sun.
Sunshine seldom reaches a room, as windows are closed on the
sunny sides during the day.</p>

<p>The natives' homes put one in mind of a squirrel's nest in a
tree. Often they are hid with banana bushes and other growths
from every side. The huts are built on poles from three to
ten feet from the ground. The frame is composed of round
and split bamboo, and the covering is generally of what is commonly
known as nipa palm. They all have a few chickens and
a pig. Their food is mostly fish and rice.</p>

<p>The presence of chickens about natives' homes is accounted
for by their weakness for cock fights. Cockpits are no
longer allowed within the city limits, but, as Manila does not
cover a large area, from 15 minutes to half an hour's ride in a
calesa will find one at a pit where the native sport is taking
place. Gambling is the incentive for that sport, and so long
as a Filipino can gamble he will not work.</p>

<p>Prize fights are not permitted in the Philippines, and it is a
criminal offense for a newspaper to publish a challenge for
bouts. Americans of sporting ilk find Manila an uncomfortable
place to live in. Every once in a while groups of free-and-easy
characters are rounded up by the authorities, taken to a ship
sailing for the United States, when they unwillingly bid good-by
to Manila's shores.</p>

<p>The climate of Manila differs from that of other countries the
same distance from the equator. A majority of Europeans
wear the same kind of hats as are worn in the States. Neither
were white clothes much worn. In other sections close to the
equator one would fall from sunstroke did he not wear a
helmet or some other heavy head-covering.</p>

<p>The city and country around Manila is flat and swampy.
When a season of heavy rain occurs the suburbs are partly under
water, many of the streets being in a deplorable condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Both the sewerage and water systems are modern, however, but
some of the business streets are poorly paved.</p>

<p>Several daily newspapers are printed in the capital, but, aside
from a white man being in charge, the printers are mostly
natives. The same applies to the island printing office located
in Manila. Wages paid the native printers are from $18 to
$25 a month. Laborers receive from 50 to 75 cents a day.
American mechanics receive about the same wages as those paid
in the States.</p>

<p>Soldiers, in khaki uniforms, are always to be seen about the
streets of Manila, a fort being located just outside the city. A
similar uniform is worn by the British troops in some of their
colonies, but the uniform worn by the American soldier looks
neater, for the reason that the American uniform is starched,
while the Britisher's is ironed. Both police and soldiers are
gentlemanly fellows.</p>

<p>Evicting the dead sounds strange, but this takes place in
Paco Cemetery, in Manila. The dead are placed in niches
built in a wall, from six to seven feet thick, which encloses an
area of three acres of land. The wall is perhaps eight feet
high, and three niches, or burial places, are built one under the
other, with a wall partition between. Rent must be paid for
these niches, and when friends fail to meet the bills the remains
are taken out and placed in a heap with others formerly evicted.
One may pay rent for these burial vaults as long as he wishes,
but from five to ten years seemed to be the length of time relatives
retained regard for the departed. The graveyard is over
a hundred years old, but the dates appearing on the slabs of the
vaults bear record only of deaths within five to ten years. All
the burial places are not like Paco, however, as in a number of
cemeteries the dead are placed underground. The total number
of vaults in Paco Cemetery will accommodate 1,782 bodies.</p>

<p>Hotel accommodation can be had for $2 a day. Boarding
houses charge from $40 to $60 a month. Similar articles cost
considerably more in Manila than they do in the States. No
duty is levied on American imports when brought to the islands
in American ships.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>Manila is divided by the Pasig River, and a busy shipping
place it is. North of the Pasig is the business center of the city,
and, save for some shipping, there is little business on the other
side of the dividing water. The old walled city, however, is
located south of the Pasig. The wall itself is the oldest on
American soil. Compared with that at Canton, it is limited,
as the Manila wall contains an area of less than a mile.
Its construction was started in 1591, but was not completed until
1872. The Spaniards did not seem to be in much of a hurry to
finish the work. However, it served as a protection from
assaults by Chinese and by the Moros; but in 1762 the English
led a successful attack on this defense. Built in the walls are
numerous chambers which had been used as cells for prisoners,
and in some of these, after American occupation, were found instruments
of torture, and even human bones. The churches
and convents still stand behind the strong walls, and bear witness
to the suffering, bravery and endurance in the early history
of the Philippines. Some of the buildings in Intramuros are
used as government offices. Originally seven gates led to the
enclosure, but the Americans decided these were not enough,
and two more openings were made. The fort and enclosure
were built to command a wide view of Manila Bay, allowing a
good stretch of land to intervene between the historic wall and
the shore.</p>

<p>Manila has a splendid fire department, good schools, numerous
churches, museums and libraries, theaters, sports grounds,
hospitals, charities organizations, a very good municipal ice
manufacturing plant, and club buildings. One will find in that
far-off possession most of the advantages to be had in the cities
of the United States.</p>

<p>Baseball games are played here the year round, and the
Filipino clubs make a good showing.</p>

<p>Good steamship accommodation could formerly be had for
$125 on intermediate ships from Manila to San Francisco, but
recently the rate has advanced $50. On the larger ships, first-class,
the fare is $250. The sailing time between the two
points is about a month, the distance being 8,000 miles. Much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
cheaper rates can be had on Japanese ships, second-class, but if
one can afford the difference in price the $175 rate is worth the
increased sum in accommodation. The increase of $50 on the
intermediate vessels has diverted considerable travel from
American to Japanese ships, because many people cannot afford
to pay the higher sum.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>We left Manila with passage paid to San Francisco. Out
through the splendid bay we sailed, when the ship was headed
for Hongkong, where ships were changed. Leaving at night, a
flare of light in the business center of Hongkong gradually
tapered up the side of the mountain to the fort on the summit,
nearly 2,000 feet. We had started for Shanghai, China.
Every ship that leaves Hongkong for San Francisco, of whatever
nationality, has Americans aboard. After two and a half
days' sailing the ship anchored off Wusung, where the sea was
yellow with the muddy water of the great Yangtse River delta.
A ship tender was boarded and a start made up the Huangpu
River, which was crowded with ships, and along and away
from the banks smoke-stacks towered for 14 miles, when
the boat was made fast to a wharf at Shanghai. From the
wharf, looking over a strip of green, there rose a wall of big,
solid, clean-looking business buildings, nearly as good as one
will find in any city of the world.</p>

<p>One has a varied choice of post offices in Shanghai, as there
are seven, representing as many nationalities. These are
French, Russian, German, American, British, Japanese and
Chinese. Shanghai is another Chinese city known as a "treaty
port," which signifies that China had granted land concessions
to one or more nations, on which to build cities&mdash;forts, if
necessary&mdash;and collect revenues from imports, and in some instances
from exports, passing through the treaty port. Chinese
live in some of the concessions, but they make their home in
these districts only by sufferance of the country, or countries, to
whom these tracts have been granted. The Chinese residents
have neither voice nor vote in the smallest matters pertaining to
the general government of treaty settlements. Large numbers
of Chinese living in both the French and International Settlements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
found protection under these flags during native wars,
when their own country could not offer them a place of safety.</p>

<p>In 1843 British troops occupied Shanghai, and by that means
a land concession was gained from China. About the same
time the United States was granted a similar concession, and
seven years later France had also acquired a land grant there.
The American and British concessions were amalgamated in
1863, but France would not join the two English-speaking nations
in the formation of one foreign settlement. The title of
the American and English land tract is "The Foreign Community
of Shanghai North of the Yangkingpang," but the territory
is commonly termed "The International Settlement."
Since the pooling of interests by England and the United States
additional territory has been acquired from China, until the International
Settlement now comprises an area of 6,000 acres of
land; while France, choosing independence, has only the original
concession, 358 acres. Self-governing powers are exercised by
the International Settlement, which includes imposing taxation
and policing the territory. A council governs the Settlement,
and the members are elected by European residents who pay a
house rental of $400 and by landowners whose property valuation
would bring that sum annually if rented. Land cannot
be bought outright for building or speculative purposes, as the
land was conceded on terms of perpetual lease. No matter how
much interests a Chinaman may have within the Settlement
boundary he cannot vote on municipal matters. Harbor dues,
import and export taxes&mdash;any revenue from commerce passing
in or going out through the section of the harbor owned by the
respective countries&mdash;is collected by the officials of that country.
The United States has the better section of the water-front,
but English and Japanese ships practically control the
trade of that important port.</p>

<p>Shanghai is the distributing center for the commerce of the
thickly populated sections on the Yangtse River. Large ships
can travel on the Yangtse in certain seasons of the year as far
inland as Hankow, 600 miles from the delta. Then smaller
vessels go on to Ichang, 400 miles still further inland, and river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
craft from there carry cargoes to Soufu, 500 miles further, or
1,500 miles inland from Shanghai. The total length of the
Yangste, which rises in the mountains of Thibet, with its tributaries,
is 3,000 miles. The width of the river at the delta is
30 miles. Shanghai is mentioned in history dating back 2,000
years.</p>

<p>Professional mourners, or weepers, at funerals is an occupation
in China that brings in a good fee, if the weeper be a good
crier. Preceding a funeral is what one may term a band, the
instruments producing noise being brass pans or trays, beaten by
men. After the pan-beaters come several Chinese, wearing
high, fluffy hats. The coffin, which is generally a log of wood
shaped out and of cylindrical form, follows the men wearing the
strange headgear. The coffin is borne on two bamboo poles, two
Chinamen at each end&mdash;four carriers in all. Relatives and
friends of the deceased follow, either walking or riding in a
ricksha, wheelbarrow, or carriage. Among this group a woman
will be heard crying lustily. It is really touching to hear the
deep intonations of grief as vented in a loud, mournful sound,
until it becomes known that the apparently grief-stricken woman
is a professional mourner, never having known the deceased
in life.</p>

<p>Women and men do not play parts together on a Chinese
theatrical stage. The actresses generally wear long beards and
mope around the stage, showing no more life than that of a
snake when the frost is being thawed out of his body by an
early springtime sun. To a European the plot is long drawn
out, lifeless, and even tedious. But the Chinese have a way
of overcoming this, as tea drinking seems to be as much a
factor of the playhouse as the performance. Small tables resting
on bamboo-pole legs are placed about the seating space of
the theater. One will no sooner have got settled in the seat
than a waiter will appear and place a teapot and cup and saucer
before the attendant. Neither milk nor sugar accompanies the
tea, and the charge is ten cents. In a short time another
waiter, carrying in his hand a stack of steaming towels, will
stop at the table and lay a hot cloth over the teapot. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
pauses, for the price of the towel is five cents. Later, still
another towel fellow stops, removes the one the first man
placed over the teapot, puts a fresh steaming cloth over it, waits
until he has received the five cents, and walks on. The hot
towel serves a dual purpose&mdash;keeps the tea warm, and is used
on the face and hands to regale the weary theatergoers while
enduring the mopy performance. In the cheaper section of a
theater, what looks like a store counter is built, from which the
"gallery gods" drink tea.</p>

<p>The Chinese of Shanghai appeared to be in better circumstances
than those in Canton. The young women are very distinctive,
and were seen to better advantage than in other places.
The millinery era has not reached China, so far as applies to
Chinese women, and for that reason most of them go about
without head covering. When one is seen wearing anything
on the head, it is generally a man's cap. Chinese women are
very particular about their hair, and, when not all combed back,
it rests on the forehead, like bangs. Hundreds of young women
may be seen with bare head, wearing a shiny silk jacket and
snug-fitting trousers. They are straight as an arrow, and their
rosy cheeks, unassuming manners, tidy hair, and generally neat
appearance unite to their credit. The Chinese boys are mischievous
little fellows, and all the children seemed fat and
strong, with rosy cheeks. The "Chink kid" was the most
attractive we had met. All the children seemed to have double
the amount of clothes necessary, and most of them wore bulky
shoes, made of grass and reeds.</p>

<p>Chinese cooks, as a rule, are paid no regular salary. They
agree to feed a family for a certain sum a month, and the
money not used out of the fixed food allowance is his. He does
the marketing, and it is needless to add there is some sharp bargaining
between grocer and butcher and the cook. For a
European family of six a cook would agree to furnish food for
from $50 to $60 a month. Beef and mutton sold at 15 cents a
pound. Vegetables, however, were proportionately cheaper.</p>

<p>One of the courts of the Settlement is known as "the Mixed
Court." A Chinese judge presides, but there is always an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
American or an English official sitting on the bench with the
native judge. Punishment is meted out to the native not as
the Chinese authority would have it, but as the white officials
suggest. Most of the black and yellow races prefer to be adjudged
by a white man, for a white judge will have more of the
milk of human kindness in his heart than a colored official.
Like Indians, the upper class of Chinese seem to be little concerned
about the condition of the poor and starving. The well-to-do
Chinese give alms to the needy often, to be sure, but that
apparently laudable trait is practiced more out of fear of a
beggar's curse, when evil days would befall him. The high-caste
Indian also gives to mendicants to ward off evil days.</p>

<p>The Native City is located outside the bounds of the Settlements
concession, where Chinese were as numerous, and the
streets as narrow, as some in Canton, but of much smaller area.
Some of the territory within the wall was under water&mdash;a
pond&mdash;over which a bridge had been built. The bridge was
purposely built nearly zigzag to foil the Evil One if he should
pursue any of them. Beggars were very numerous in that section
of Shanghai, and the mothers, like those seen in Canton,
begged, at the same time holding up the little hand of a babe,
in which one might put any offering. The Long-Hau pagoda,
seven stories in height, located outside the city, is a credit to
Chinese skill.</p>

<p>Few horses were seen drawing loads in Shanghai. Most of
the cartage and trucking is done on bamboo poles by Chinamen
and with hand trucks, pulled by ropes and shoved. Five
Chinese pull the same load a horse would draw.</p>

<p>The condition of the ricksha pullers of Shanghai is pitiable.
Fifteen thousand Chinese are engaged in this occupation, some
of them so weak that they frequently fall to the ground from
exhaustion, caused by an empty stomach. When a Chinaman
quails under hard work it is because he has not a fighting
chance to make a showing. Chinese pay them two and three
cents for a ride, while Europeans pay five cents and over. The
owners of the rickshas pay 75 cents a month to the Settlement
as a license fee, and the puller must pay the owner 40 cents a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
day. Often, when a puller has not earned the rental sum, 40
cents, he will remain in the streets all day and most of the
night in the hope of at least earning the required charge. If
he cannot pay the 40 cents he is deprived of his occupation until
he has settled for the last ricksha.</p>

<p>The wheelbarrow of this city, used to carry passengers and
move goods, is the oddest device in use the world over. It
differs from similar vehicles in that the wheel is in the center
of the frame instead of in front. Above the wheel is also a
frame, on which to carry articles of light weight. A rope is
tied to each end of the barrow handles, and the loop rests on
the Chinaman's neck, passing under his arms. A Chinaman
will wheel a weight of half a ton for miles on this crude device.
An article may weigh 500 pounds which cannot be divided&mdash;must
be carried on one side, the other side free of weight&mdash;yet
he will short-step along with the one-sided load until he
has reached his destination. The barrow will not tip over.
On each side of the wheel may often be seen sitting Chinese
women with bare heads, wearing white blouses with pink
stripes about the sleeves, with baggy velvet trousers, and snow-white
stockings showing over neat, boat-shaped, black or colored
velvet shoes. Passengers get a long ride on the wheelbarrow
for from two to five cents. The owner pays a license fee of
40 cents a month for his crude vehicle.</p>

<p>Windows of Chinese temples, and sometimes other buildings,
are the same as those seen in Manila&mdash;light colored seashell.</p>

<p>Both the dollar and the tael are in use in Shanghai, the
former worth from 40 to 50 cents and the tael about 65 cents.</p>

<p>Chinese mechanics are paid from 20 to 40 cents a day.
Printers receive $10 to $18 a month. The working time is
eight or nine hours a day. Carpenters were on strike for an
increase of from two to five cents a day. If a Chinaman hod-carrier,
or one working at unskilled labor, should be taken
sick, the wife will often take his place until her husband is able
to resume work.</p>

<p>An unfriendly feeling seemed to be harbored toward Americans
by other Europeans living in the Chinese coast cities. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
was claimed that since American occupation of the Philippines
the cost of living had advanced 50 per cent., as the influx of
Europeans to the islands had created a greater demand for
Chinese meat, vegetables and other necessities. Hotel expenses
were very reasonable in Shanghai, however, as $1.50 a day
only was paid.</p>

<p>Bombay, India, was the most attractive city visited in the
East, and Shanghai, China, with a population of a million inhabitants,
was the second best city. Between the landing place
on the river and the splendid front of buildings that give a
visitor his first impression of the metropolis of the Yangtse is a
stretch of green, grass-covered land, known as the Bund. To
the right, opening off the park strip, are the Public Gardens.
A good street car system is a feature of the city, and electric
lights are numerous. In any direction one may look, enterprise
and good management are in evidence. The river is
teeming with craft, large and small vessels loading and unloading
at each side of the waterway, and high smoke-stacks, rising
from cotton and paper mills and shipbuilding yards, add much
to the thrifty surroundings; then large oil tanks, busy warehouses,
and the gunboats of great nations anchored in the
river give the place a metropolitan appearance, while the
buildings at every turn are good. The streets are crowded
with people, and the stores filled with purchasers, most of the
merchants in that section of the city being Europeans. The
attractive buildings on the Bund do not comprise all of the good
buildings of Shanghai, for some of the homes, built of red and
gray-colored brick, two and three stories in height, are good
to look at. Then there are sidewalks to the Shanghai streets,
which are well paved with asphalt and granite blocks, and
these are kept clean. Many churches are to be seen. Schools
are frequently met with, and parks have been placed at convenient
sections; also a horse racecourse, sports grounds, and good
hospitals. In fact, both English and United States officials have
done well in the upbuilding of the International Settlement.</p>

<p>Down the Huangpu River, the channel walled by merchant
ships and gunboats, we sail to Wusung, where an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
ship was boarded for Japan. Most of the passengers came from
Manila, and were returning to the States to regain their health
and seek employment in a country where people can drink water
and eat raw fruit or vegetables, whether grown in the ground or
on trees. The first thing noticed among the passengers was
the absence of strong drink during meals. Stimulants are a
feature at mealtime with almost every other nationality traveling
in the Far East. A day and a half's sail through the base of
the Yellow Sea brought us to Nagasaki, Japan.</p>

<p>After the vessel had anchored, flat boats or scows loaded with
coal, and also with Japanese men and women, were seen heading
toward her. The women were to help load the ship with
bunker coal. Each woman and girl had over her head a white
cloth, with large, black Japanese characters stamped in the
print. Grass baskets, that hold but a shovelful, are used to
coal ships at this Japanese port. The scows have been made
fast to the ship, the baskets are being filled, the coal passing
line is formed from the barge to the vessel, extending up a
ladder to a hatch over the bunkers. The tidy looking women
are now passing baskets from one to the other as quickly as one
would hand a plate to another if needed at once. A stream
of these is constantly being tossed from one to the other, and
small girls are engaged at returning the empty ones to the
scow. Two, and even three, streams of coal run into the
bunkers from one scow by means of the handleless baskets, and,
as from three to five scows will be unloading at the same time
from both sides of the vessel, it will be understood what a
large quantity of fuel can be emptied into a ship from ten to
fifteen of these coal lines. The time required to furnish a
vessel with bunker coal in this manner is from four to five
hours. The wages of the coal passers are based on the amount
of coal a ship takes on, as an equal sum is paid the coalers.
This amounts to from 15 to 25 cents each. As many as 500
Japanese&mdash;mostly women&mdash;keep life in their bodies by this
means of employment.</p>

<p>The harbor was attractively dotted with partly green islands,
and in front the country was hilly and mostly terraced. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
terraced hills are the "farms" of the people. Every inch of
land that can be built up with rock to a level surface is used to
grow vegetables and other products.</p>

<p>Oxen, hitched to carts and wearing grass shoes, was something
that had not been seen&mdash;the grass shoes&mdash;in other
countries. A grass string passed between the hoofs, which was
connected with another grass string or rope wound about the
fetlock. These held on the shoe, or grass mat, protecting the
hoofs from wear on the roads.</p>

<p>In India boards are sawed from logs while sticking in the
air at an angle of 35 degrees, with one man on the log pulling a
crosscut saw, and another under, on a platform, pulling the
saw downward after the fellow on top had pulled the saw up.
At Nagasaki boards were being cut from logs by hand also,
but the sawyer stood on the ground and ripped the log from the
side, in the same way that meat is carved. The saw was two
feet long and a foot wide, with deep teeth, and with that implement
slabs were being ripped off logs 20 feet in length.
Like the Indian, the Jap pulls a plane toward him, while a
white carpenter shoves a plane from him. Still, one may see
any day in New York City men "chopping" wood with
granite blocks.</p>

<p>While the rest of Japan was closed to foreigners, Nagasaki,
for 200 years before the country was thrown open to the
world, was an open port, and even then life was none too
safe, as missionaries had been killed in that section. Nagasaki
has a population of 150,000, and most of the people are engaged
at coaling ships, working in a shipyard, or in pottery works.
The streets are narrow, but tidier than those seen in some
cities left behind, and the homes small, none higher than two
stories, mostly of wood construction. Ricksha pullers in this
place were a pest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span></p>

<p>Nagasaki was left behind when a start was made through
the Inland Sea for Kobe, a day's sail separating the two ports.
The sail is an attractive one, as this stretch of water is thickly
dotted with islands. Were the vegetation tropical it would
favorably compare with the journey through the Fiji group.
The Inland Sea is generally calm, and foreign ships, together
with those of Japan's large fleet of merchantmen, were winding
and twisting about the islands in every section of the noted
land-locked waterway. The vessel we boarded at Shanghai
was the third one since leaving Manila. Our journey through
Japan from Kobe will be by rail.</p>

<p>The ship anchored in the bay, and passengers were brought
to the wharves in tenders. Modern buildings were in evidence,
and street cars and railroad trains were running through
the city. In general, Kobe presents a much better appearance
than Nagasaki.</p>

<p>Almost every woman seen in Japan has a child on her back,
the mother's custom of carrying her babe, and most of the
girls also wear a bulky piece of cloth likewise, which is tied about
the waist. On a farm where there are no reckless boys, and
the head of the family is satisfied with the easier ways of life,
a colt may be seen walking about a pasture or enclosure with a
sack of grain tied to its back; this is put on the colt's back to
break it in to ride. The bundles on the girls' backs looked as
if they had been placed there for the initial lesson in carrying
a baby. The knapsack-like cloth is called the obi. Japanese
fathers seemed to take more interest in their children than
Chinese parents, as we cannot recall seeing a Chinaman carrying
a child.</p>

<p>The Japanese home is the flimsiest anywhere. Thin pine
boards, with paper windows and doors, generally one-story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
and attic, constitute their shell-like dwelling. Low stools and
mats are prominent household accessories, but no chairs or
tables. A mat on the floor serves as the seat in a Japanese
home, which is neat, and the people present a favorable appearance.
The roof is its most substantial feature, being
covered with black tiles. The doors slide to one side. Crosspieces
and upright panels compose the frames of doors, and
the squares in windows, which in Manila are of seashell, are
covered with paper in Japan. The paper is frequently broken,
when new "window panes" replace the torn ones.</p>

<p>The household stove of Japan is a portable earthen bucket,
generally white in color, with a handle. Charcoal is the fuel
generally used. This stove cooks the food of the family and
also provides heat in cold weather. The family may be seen
squatting about the white earthen bucket with twice as many
hands over the fire as there are members of the household.
A fan serves to coax the charcoal along.</p>

<p>While the Japanese are poor, they seem to be well supplied
with clothing. The flimsy character of the homes may account
for the thickness of cloth worn, as the weather gets cold
in Japan, ice and snow being in evidence. The kimono is
worn entirely by women, and generally by men. Occasionally
a man will be seen wearing European clothes, but Japanese
women are always dressed in the native garb. Some of the
small boys wear a helmet after the style worn with a coat
of mail, and look really warlike in them.</p>

<p>Both Nagasaki and Kobe are located on hilly ground, which
necessitates the building of walls in frequent sections of the
cities. These walls are very sound, and a feature of them
worth mentioning is that no mortar appears to have been used
in their construction.</p>

<p>Most of the modern buildings here were built by firms from
other countries, but there are also modern native structures.
The business quarters have sidewalks, but away from that section
there are none. No street paving was seen either in Kobe
or Nagasaki. On the hillsides the soil seemed to be hard, and
in the level sections loose gravel was used for paving.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>No cabs were seen in Kobe, but street cars and rickshas were
plentiful. Street-car fare ranged from one and one-half to
four cents. The ricksha pullers of Kobe were an improvement
on some of the starved Chinese pullers of Shanghai. A
great many of the pullers of Japan have no shoes on their feet,
but wear cloth, generally white, for protection. Walking over
gravel roads did not seem to bother the Japanese ricksha pullers.</p>

<p>Kobe has a population of nearly half a million, and is second
to Yokohama in importance as a seaport, much tea being exported
from this port. Behind the city rises a range of high
hills, covered with pine trees&mdash;a natural park. In front is
a splendid bay, from which rises many masts and smoke funnels
from vessels at anchor. Some of the streets are of good width
and others are very narrow, but all are clean. Attractive
homes have been built on the hillsides, but the high gates and
fenced and walled enclosures lend to the dwellings the air of
a prison.</p>

<p>Cloth grain sacks are never seen in the Orient. Anything
of that nature which contains goods is made of grass.</p>

<p>In the railway stations of Japan are kept on file publications
of current dates. This unusual custom seems to be appreciated
by the traveling public, as many passengers may be seen turning
page after page of the periodicals while waiting for a train.
The railways are government owned, and the fare, first-class,
is two cents, second-class one cent, and third-class one half cent
a mile. Some of the first-class coaches contain wicker chairs,
with observation platform at the rear. Second- and third-class
coaches are provided with cushioned seats at the side of the
car. The width of the tracks is from three to four feet, and
the fastest schedule is 35 miles an hour. Meals on trains cost
50 cents. By paying a small additional sum, through steamship
passengers may travel by rail on their steamship ticket from
either Nagasaki or Kobe to Yokohama, or vice versa, with
stop-over privileges at any point. Many passengers take advantage
of this liberal concession. No stations are announced,
but the name is printed in big letters on a wide board.
Strangers are informed of their destination by a trainman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
shortly after the train has pulled away from the preceding station.
The signs at stations prove a better guide to foreigners,
as Europeans are termed in Japan, than announcing them, for
words sound so much different when spoken in the native
tongue.</p>

<p>We have reached Osaka, the second largest city in Japan.
This city has a million inhabitants, and is a very important
commercial center. Few horses or oxen were seen here, most
of the cartage being done on two-wheeled trucks by men, women,
and boys. Chinese truckmen pull their loads with a rope passed
over the shoulder, but the Japanese pulls his load by his breast.
A pad is laid across his chest and a rope is put over, the ends
of which are generally fastened to the axle of the truck. It is
hard to believe that human beings can do the work of horses,
mules, and motor trucks in a manufacturing city of a million
inhabitants, but they really do so.</p>

<p>Carriages or taxicabs were not seen in the city. Ricksha is
the means by which luggage is carried and places reached when
traveling other than by street car. Street cars in Osaka are
crowded all day. Unless a car is boarded at its starting point,
it is generally a case of holding on to a strap. Four and a
half cents is charged for a street-car ticket, but there is a
coupon to each, which is good for a return journey&mdash;two and
one-quarter cents a ride. Cars are numerous, single-decked,
and they travel fast. Traffic is so heavy that two conductors
are required to collect the fares.</p>

<p>The theater district of Broadway, New York City, is termed
the "Great White Way," but some of the streets on which
bioscope and other theaters are located in Osaka also cast a
great flare of light at night. The attractions are printed on
cloth of bright color, secured to poles extending from buildings
on each side. These signs, all printed in Japanese characters,
meet in the center of the street, and large arc lights,
some of them red instead of white, illuminate the surroundings.
This, together with music, noise, and the crowds packing
the streets from curb to curb, may appropriately be termed
"The Great Colored Way." It is a sidelight of life in another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
part of the world that has to be seen to be understood. No expense
is spared in lighting in front of amusement buildings in
Osaka. The price of admission is five and ten cents, and the
places are jammed during opening hours.</p>

<p>The unit of money in Japan is the yen, which is 50 cents in
American coin. The half-yen is a silver piece; some of the
lower coins are also silver, others nickel and copper. Sen is
used as the American cent, and 100 sen makes a yen. The
plural is never used in yen or sen, always 30 sen and 20 yen.
A sen is one-half of a cent.</p>

<p>A few wide streets course the city, and modern business
buildings show up here and there, but aside from these the
buildings are of wood and the streets narrow. No paving,
however, covered the streets, neither were sidewalks in evidence.
A river flows through the city, which serves as good
drainage to this populous center.</p>

<p>The price of food is much higher in Japan than in India
and China. With the exception of Singapore and Canton,
hotel expenses did not exceed $2 a day, but $2.50 was the
cheapest for accommodation in most Japanese cities. Though
all wanted $3 a day, a little haggling brought the price down a
yen. In our hotel in Osaka the room was heated by a small
charcoal stove, of an upright gas-stove shape, instead of the
bucket kind. On first sight it seemed a joke, but it took the
chill off the room in a short time nevertheless.</p>

<p>A pleasant change in hotel service was met with here. With
the exception of Australia and New Zealand, and one place in
Durban, South Africa, at every place we stopped male servants
were the rule. After leaving South America these were black
men. With two exceptions, Delhi and Benares, there was no
such personage as a woman housekeeper seen about the hotels&mdash;men,
men, men at every place. But in Osaka, a rosy-cheeked
Japanese girl, with the "training saddle" tied to her back,
placed the charcoal in the stove, and fiery embers were slid on
top from a dustpan shovel; in the dining-room, also, the girls,
in their counterless slippers, would shuffle, shuffle, shuffle their
feet from the dining-room to the kitchen, and soon shuffle back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
with the ordered food&mdash;the sound of the girls' feet more
amusing than annoying. One wonders how hotels in some
countries exist, for often not more than half a dozen guests are
living in a big hostelry. The trade seems to come from foreigners
only, for seldom is a Japanese seen about.</p>

<p>Osaka was my first stop from Kobe, and, inquiring from a
young man how I might reach a certain point, he volunteered
to show me about the city. His kind offer was accepted. He
proved to be a professional man, could speak some English, and
seemed to take delight in doing me the slightest kindness. He
took me to a splendid park and other places of interest, and
insisted on paying his own street car and ricksha fares.</p>

<p>The working hours in Japan are ten a day. Mechanics receive
75 cents and laborers from 30 to 40 cents a day. Rice,
fish, and tea seemed to be the principal food, and if the quantities
of food were no larger in proportion than some of the
teacups in use, people live cheaply. A man seen eating a bowl
of fish and rice with chopsticks was asked what he had paid
for it, a vendor having just sold it; he said 30 sen&mdash;15 cents.
Ten cents would seem a big price for the same portion in
America.</p>

<p>Osaka is intersected by canals, and over a thousand bridges
within the city lines cross these waterways, resembling Amsterdam,
Holland, in this respect. There are nearly 2,000 places
of worship, hundreds of schools, colleges, and academies, five
daily newspapers, paper mills, machine shops, and an arsenal.
Tea, silk, and copper figure largely in the exports from that
busy center.</p>

<p>If few modern buildings, narrow streets, latticed front and
part paper homes, one story in height, and shops located in
these buildings, illustrate Japanese progress, then Kyoto, next
visited, is to the fore. The old west capital, as Kyoto is termed,
puts one in mind of a pile of wood boxes that have been
gathered together to make a bonfire. This city is one huge
tinder box. In size Kyoto is the third city of Japan, with a
population of half a million people, and it is the bucket stove
alone that saves the residents from becoming homeless through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
the ravages of fire, for if wood and coal stoves were used there
would be frequent conflagrations. The roofs are covered with
black tiling, and the houses have no chimneys.</p>

<p>The bazaars or shopping centers of these cities are busy
places, and resemble an arcade. These are formed by reed
blinds being placed above the street, which, pulled by ropes,
roll on wires and stretch across, preventing the sun from shining
below&mdash;similar to those in Canton. Meat is scarce about
these shopping places, but rice, beans, dried fish, and vegetables
are much in evidence. Radishes serve the same purpose in
Japan as potatoes in America; they grow as large as a big
cucumber, and when numerous in vegetable stalls an unpleasant
odor arises from them.</p>

<p>When a horse or an ox was seen drawing a truck, the
driver was always found at the side, or leading it by a rope; it
seemed to be the custom not to ride in a loaded vehicle. Cabs
are not seen in the city, ricksha pullers doing the hack work.
A great many of the public streets are too narrow for a carriage
to pass through. Men do most of the trucking.</p>

<p>Pulling a rope depending from a bell, to warn the spirits that
a devotee has come to worship at a shrine, is a national religious
custom of Japan. In front of each temple a thick rope
dangles from a bell above, and, as the finger-soiled Bible indicates
the owner's studious religious tendencies, so does the
frayed ropes attest the frequency with which worshippers summon
the spirits to bear witness to the supplicant's invocations.</p>

<p>Kyoto is well provided with attractive temples, built during
the residence in that city of the governing powers. These
buildings, like the homes, are constructed of wood, and as one
walks about the churches the floors often squeak. As in India,
shoes must be covered with canvas slippers before entering.
The Japanese, also like Indian worshipers, leave their clogs
or sandals outside. Priests are in attendance, and one of these
escorts a stranger through the building. If the temple be a
Shinto place of worship the priests are considered descendants
of the Sun. In one respect there is no similarity between the
priests here and those met in India, as the Japanese officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
were free of the spirit of beggary. A fee is charged on entering&mdash;generally
from 10 to 25 cents&mdash;and that is all that is
expected.</p>

<p>No seats, pianos or organs were seen in the temples, but the
floors were covered with mats, on which the worshipers kneel.
Off the main church are rooms, where tapestry, with holy
figures outlined, hang on the walls, and shrines are sometimes
found in the cloisters. The temples are generally located in
attractive grounds, often used by children at play. About the
buildings are stone or cement posts, on top of which is a four-cornered
cap, with a roof or covering larger than the pillar;
these represent square lanterns. Under the roof the inside is
hollow, with four corners as supports. Lights, put in these,
radiate from the four openings. It is one of the sacred emblems
of Japan, and hundreds of these lanterns stand in temple
enclosures, each one the gift of a well-to-do adherent of the
faith. The temples are covered by a roof which seems out of
proportion to the building. The eaves are very deep, the
supports often richly carved, the designs generally typifying
some feature of the religion. The entrance to a Shinto temple
is always marked by two stone or wood posts, one on each
side, from 12 to 18 feet in height. About two feet below the
top a long, straight beam of stone, from a foot to eighteen
inches wide, rests in mortises of the upright posts. As the cross
stone is solid, one end is placed in the mortise of one pillar
and placed across to enter the mortise in the opposite one, the
ends extending from two to four feet from the pillars. On
top of these posts rest a wide stone cap piece of warped appearance.
The whole is called a torii, and appears only at the entrance
of a Shinto temple. For walks, the enclosures are covered
with gravel, like the streets, or the natural soil serves the
purpose of tiling or pavement. They bear no resemblance to
temples seen in the other countries visited, neither are they as expensively
fitted as some of the mosques and temples in India.</p>

<p>Poor people of other countries do not, as a rule, have two
pairs of shoes, but every Japanese seemed to possess that coveted
number. When we say shoes, we mean something&mdash;anything&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
keep the feet from the ground. The Japanese "shoes"
are pieces of wood, a trifle longer than the foot, arched at a
point between the joint of the toes and instep, with heavy braid.
Another strip of braid, coming from the point of the shapened
wood on which the foot rests, is secured to the cross braid,
which fits in between the big toe and the next. Under the footboard
are fastened two other thin pieces of wood, two to three
inches apart, and sometimes three inches high, resembling the
bridge of a violin. In wet weather, high-bridged clogs are worn
to keep the feet from the ground, and in dry weather low-bridged
clogs are used. Sandals are worn by some Japanese,
but the bridge clog is the shoe of Japan. High-bridge clogs
make more noise than low-bridge ones, and when a dozen persons
walk on a sidewalk wearing this footgear one knows the
Japanese are coming. The clogs cost from 30 to 50 cents a
pair.</p>

<p>Bathing in Japan is a custom that must not be overlooked.
In the country districts one tub&mdash;of wood&mdash;is used by a
family. Often the bathing takes place in a yard, and the members
go through with the custom, one after the other, while
steam is on the water. The same water answers the purpose
of all.</p>

<p>Small hens' eggs and two-wheeled vehicles go hand in hand
in the Orient, as in both respects, particularly in pigeon-sized
eggs, the Japanese products are the same as first met with in
Bombay, India.</p>

<p>Kyoto is flat, with a pine-tree covered hill behind, on which
a number of temples stand. Looking over the city from this
elevation, it reminds one of a huge lumber yard. By reason
of fires having occurred frequently, a few wide streets course the
flat site, and not more than half a dozen modern buildings rise
above the one-story, flimsy homes. Without these fire-swept
tracts there would be no street cars in some Japanese cities.
In Osaka and other cities the ravages by fire are being taken
advantage of to replace the alleys with wide streets. Dwarfed
pines, fruit trees, bulbs, and other plants are seen at many
homes. The Japanese are poor, and are taxed heavily by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
government; still, the full, rosy cheeks of both women and
children would not suggest the hard conditions they are forced
to endure to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p>Kyoto, the literary center of Japan, is also noted for its porcelain,
lacquer goods, cutlery, hardware, and silk manufactories.</p>

<p>Comfortable chairs in a clean passenger coach, with an observation
compartment at the rear, and but four foreigners as
passengers, was the agreeable manner in which we started for
Yokohama. At nearly every stop the platforms of the coaches
were not only swept but washed. Nothing was lacking to
insure comfort, and the train traveled at a speed of 30 miles an
hour; but, like the flimsy homes of the people, the coach, which
was a first-class one, was not the solid car that one is accustomed
to in other countries. The railway stations were of
good construction, however, being clean and tidy.</p>

<p>Along the route women and girls were seen carrying bundles
of coarse grass and reeds from the hills. In China men are
seen carrying on their shoulders large numbers of shoes made
from such material. In rice fields, and where other grain had
been cut, the stubble was level with the ground&mdash;nothing
allowed to go to waste. A great many of the hills were terraced
with stone walls in order to raise food to live on. At
one section of the road the train passed through a valley, hills
rising from each side. The soil was naturally rich and of
considerable depth. Women and men were engaged here in
shoveling dirt into grass baskets, which was carried up steep
hills and deposited near the top on small patches of land that
had been made level by building stone walls to prevent storms
from washing the soil back again into the valley. Often a
Shinto shrine appeared, and peasants as they passed bowed, bent
their knees, and moved their lips. All seemed to be warmly
clad, had rosy cheeks, and none looked untidy; nor was there
any begging at the railway stations. On we went, winding
about hills, then through valleys, until, after rounding a sharp
turn, a white mountain loomed up in front and to the left&mdash;Mount
Fujiyama, the sacred mountain of Japan, which rises to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
height of 12,365 feet, located 86 miles from Yokohama. By
early evening we had reached the cradle of modern Japan.</p>

<p>To Commodore M. C. Perry, of the United States Navy,
credit is given for starting a new era in the history of Japan,
at Yokohama, in 1854. Yokohama is to Japan what Shanghai
and other cities are to China&mdash;a world treaty port. Commodore
Perry practically forced Japan to open her gates to other
nations of the world, after they had been locked for 2,000
years against all, except the Dutch at Nagasaki. As in the
treaty ports of China, the hand of the white man is in evidence
at every turn in the good docks, warehouses, customs houses,
splendid postoffice building, good bank building, racecourse,
public gardens; wide streets, with pavement, some having walks;
gas, electricity, street cars, and other signs of progress. A short
distance from the concession strip of land the native city is
located, with the usual small frame dwellings and narrow, unpaved
streets. In 1859 a foreign settlement was established,
where only a fishing village had stood previously, but to-day
Yokohama is the leading seaport city of Japan and the terminus
of ships sailing from European and American ports.</p>

<p>Beyond the business center of the city, on an elevation known
as the Bluff, foreigners live. These residents have their
churches, libraries, clubs and societies, and are free from any interference.
Horses and oxen, instead of human beings, were
found pulling loads of merchandise, and cranes at the docks were
used to load and unload the thousands of vessels that come and
go. A good railway station adds to the appearance of this
foreign city, but there is little native interest to be observed
compared to other typical Japanese centers.</p>

<p>At Kamakura, an hour's ride from Yokohama, is located the
great Daibutsu, the Japanese Buddha, 49½ feet high, with a
circumference of nearly a hundred feet. The Daibutsu is
composed of bronze plates, brazed together, and has eyes, four
feet in length, of gold. In the center of the forehead is a silver
ball, denoting wisdom. The ear lobes are very long and the
hair curly. This great image rests on a stone foundation, and
the position of the Buddha is that of sitting down, hands folded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
in reverential meditation, the feet being partly under. It is
hollow inside, and a shrine has been erected within for worshipers.
A ladder leads to the top of the Daibutsu. Kamakura
has been sacked by warfare, racked by volcanoes, and
ravaged by fires on various occasions, but for 600 years the
great image has remained in the same position. It is a striking
work of art. From the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries Kamakura
was the capital of the Shogunate, and at one time had a
population of a million people, but to-day it is but a seaside
village.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p>An hour's ride from Yokohama, Tokyo, the capital of Japan,
is reached. The water here is shallow, Yokohama being practically
the port for the official city of Japan. Tokyo has more
open space than other native cities, and street cars, rickshas and
crowds of people about the railway station gave ample evidence
of having reached a large center. One of the main streets of
the capital city is wide, with sidewalks, and good business
buildings rise at frequent sections along the thoroughfare.
Goods were displayed in the windows, and clerks were on their
feet; whereas in other cities Japanese merchants, like the Indians,
were seen sitting down on an elevation or low counter,
with feet partly under and the sandals or clogs on the floor.
Away from the business street, however, are the one-story frame
dwellings, with latticed-like doors, having white paper in the
window squares to admit light. Outside the home are several
pairs of clogs, as, again like the East Indian, Japanese enter in
stockinged feet. The same sliding doors were here, too, and
the streets were as narrow and as free of pavement as those of
Kyoto and other cities. The charcoal buckets were surrounded
by members of the family, each one seeming to take turn in
fanning the embers to a stronger heat.</p>

<p>A visitor would find difficulty in getting about Tokyo, as the
street signs, where they appear, are printed in Japanese, and the
same applies to those on street cars. Large, modern street cars
were in use, and the travel was so heavy that two conductors,
as in Osaka, were kept busy collecting fares. The fare was
the same as that in other cities&mdash;4½ cents with a return coupon,
or 2¼ cents a single ride. Traffic keeps up from morning
until late at night. A stranger would do well to have written
down in the Japanese language on a piece of paper where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
wishes to leave the car, as no English is spoken by conductors,
and the pronunciation of the names of places is not at all as
the spelling of the word would suggest in English. As many
people held on to the straps as were seated.</p>

<p>Japanese believe in the merit of water, as was evidenced in
the sprinkling of streets, these being partly muddy all the time,
which suggests that high-bridge clogs are generally worn. Very
few of the streets were paved with asphalt or blocks, the paving
peculiar to Japan&mdash;loose gravel&mdash;being in evidence on most
of them. Many canals and a few rivers run through the city,
and bridges are frequently met with; some of these are of iron.</p>

<p>One misses restaurants, bakeries, and similar stores when
traveling through the Far East. Not enough foreigners live
in these parts of the world to create a demand for such
eating places. Rice is the principal food, and one never sees a
loaf of bread or a cake displayed in store windows. Eating is
confined to the home or hotel.</p>

<p>Tokyo covers an area of 100 square miles, and good parks
are included within its boundaries. The grounds about the
Mikado's palace and the government buildings, the latter of
European design, are in keeping with a national capital. A
high wall surrounds the grounds in which the palace is situated,
and a moat, containing clear water, separates the wall
from streets on each side. The effect that should accompany
an imperial residence is marred, however, as the entrance to the
passageway leading to the grounds was enclosed with an unshapely
frame structure, guarded by soldiers. The streets
through that section of the city were paved with loose gravel.
Green stretches of grass and park spaces, together with splendid
vistas, characterize the scene about the location of the imperial
palace. Visitors are not allowed to enter.</p>

<p>The police and military systems of Japan are so perfect that
a foreigner's whereabouts while in the country will be accounted
for by the authorities to the minute. The officers have shelters
to stand in throughout the city, in which a telephone is
placed. None seemed officious, but they can put their hands
on a visitor any time they have occasion to do so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p>At one end of the city is located what is familiarly known
as Asakusa Temple, the church of the poor, the grounds and
buildings of which are nearly always crowded with people.
On and near the grounds are seen fortune tellers, fakirs, toy
vendors, flaring advertisements, observation towers, side shows,
idols and altars, and the clatter of clogs is loudly heard. In
front of this temple are shrines, one of them erected to Binguru,
the helper of the sick. Binguru is made of stone, and wears a
pink bib. The people believe that by rubbing an affected part
of the body on the stone image they will be cured. As a result,
Binguru is growing less in weight from year to year by reason
of so many hands coming in contact with the stone god. Priests
sell pictures of the goddess Kwannon, which, the people believe,
will bring them good fortune&mdash;a baby boy to a home, for instance&mdash;and,
in a general sense, keep away evil days. Then
the church treasury is replenished by priests telling fortunes.
The contribution box is different to those seen in any other
temple, being 6 feet long and 18 inches deep, with strips of
wood nailed across the top, one side higher than the other.
Between the strips over the top were openings of two inches. A
railing separates the money trough from worshipers. Though
the people are not burdened with money, the coins rattling in
that cattle-guard-like money-box sounded like rain dropping on
a tin roof.</p>

<p>The amusement center of Tokyo is located a few squares
from Asakusa Temple. Hundreds of theaters stand within a
short radius, and the life of the Chinese and Japanese peoples
reaches its zenith in these districts. The streets are literally
emblazoned from both sides with vari-colored canvas, containing,
in Japanese, an account of what is going on inside the
buildings. Pictures of the show are painted on sheets of cloth
in red, yellow, orange, black, blue&mdash;in fact, all colors&mdash;and
large lights hang thickly above these&mdash;truly a striking combination
of light and hues. The charge for these performances
is from 2½ to 10 cents.</p>

<p>At one theater, where admission was five cents, foreigners'
shoes had to be covered with cloth. It seemed as if religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
custom was being carried too far to be halted by an attendant
with a pair of canvas slippers to conceal leather from the floor
of a five-cent show house. After leaving and walking a square's
distance from the building, a man stepped in front and offered
10 sen, the sum paid for admission, but, having forfeited all
claim to it, I continued on my way. But that would not do,
the usher refusing to leave until I had accepted the 10 sen.
Thereupon I returned to the theater, bought another ticket,
and submitted to slippers custom.</p>

<p>A trench was being dug on one of the main streets away from
the business center, and a pile driver was used to drive heavy
scantlings for shoring. The iron weight was raised by ropes,
pulled by women. Pulleys were fastened to the top of the
derrick, and ropes ran over these. A dozen women were engaged
at the work, each one with a rope in her hand, and if the
ropes had been colored the scene would have resembled that of
a Maypole gathering. They all pulled together when the
weight was to be raised, and some of the pullers, stepping back
as the weight came nearer the top, danced, hummed a keep-step
song, and joined in laughter at the same time. When the
weight reached the top of the derrick, all let go the ropes, and
gave a shout as it hit the top of the shoring post.</p>

<p>Celebrating the advent of cherry blossoms is a religious custom
of Japan. One would naturally think cherries were a
common luxury in that country, but it happens that the trees
only flower, and do not bear fruit. In a general sense, flowers
and trees figure largely in the life of the Japanese nation, which
suggests the deep-rooted growth Shintoism has taken. In January,
when it is cold, even plum and other trees blossom, which
proves a source of joy to the people. The pine tree typifies long
life, and the bamboo uprightness. The lotus is another sacred
plant of the Land of the Rising Sun, and the lesson taught from
that flower is that purity comes out of impurity. The lotus
will grow in dirty pools, but the open flower will be as pure as
if grown in a clear mountain stream. But the greatest nature
festivals take place during the cherry blossom season, and
later, when the chrysanthemum is in bloom. The wistaria is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
another sacred flower. Girls and women dress themselves in
their best kimonos and fasten on their back their richest obi, all
taking keen delight in parading under the bowers of flowering
trees and vines.</p>

<p>In Japan a stranger will always find some one to speak to
him, to bow, to give him a smile, as in India. A card may be
handed the visitor, with an invitation to call at a certain address&mdash;a
store, for instance. The Japanese have acquired the
highest science in lacquer and in damascene work. Lacquer
work is done by a varnish made of dissolved shellac and other
chemicals, and woodwork of various designs are finished in a
highly polished manner. Gold, silver, ivory, bronze, and
mother-of-pearl are often inlaid on the designs offered for sale.
The damascene work is ornamented metal, done by inlaying or
incorporating patterns, usually of another metal, and smoothing
and polishing the whole surface; or in engraving designs,
with deep-cut lines, inlaying gold wires, and rubbing these down
level. Another form of damascening is the making of small
holes in a base metal, filling these with gold, and then burnishing
the article. There are also other forms, and the Japanese
and Chinese seem to have mastered that art to a higher degree
than other races. Runners for these merchants seldom fail in
meeting visitors.</p>

<p>"Look," said a Japanese acquaintance, pointing to a small
girl of the same race. As Japanese bear a resemblance from one
end of the islands to the other, no difference could be seen in
that particular girl from others passing by. He then explained.
The girl wore a long apron, the sort American girls
wear at school and about the home. Children wearing aprons
was an innovation in clothes, and American women teachers
in that country introduced the "style."</p>

<p>Men with pads across their chests work like truck horses in
Tokyo. Women also were seen engaged at the same hard
work. Aside from street cars, rickshas were the conveyances
mostly used to get about the city. A great many of the pullers
wear neither clogs nor sandals, their feet being covered with a
cloth slipper. Still, they seemed to be in better circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
than those seen in Shanghai. Fare, however, is higher than
in other countries passed through. Few automobiles were seen
in Japan.</p>

<p>Tokyo is supplied with good temples, and the skill of the
Japanese in the lacquer art is shown in these buildings. The
supports in some of the churches have been treated to dozens of
coats of lacquer, and the ceilings richly inlaid with gold leaf,
often worked in flower designs. The carving on the enclosures
and doors is good, but the more noted is the handicraft of
Chinese. Mats are used on the floors of the temples, and valuable
Japanese tapestry is shown to visitors. Some of the
church enclosures contain hundreds of stone lanterns. As in
other Japanese cities, there were no beggars.</p>

<p>In one of several creditable city parks is a good museum, the
building being very imposing. The same ground, containing
temples, has an interesting zoo. In this park the principal
cherry blossom celebrations take place. Industrial museums
are also found in other sections of the city. A visit to the capital
of the Mikado proves interesting.</p>

<p>The geisha is composed of women whose occupation is dancing
and entertaining. Through the artfulness of this class, the
hand of the geisha often reaches to the legislative halls of Parliament.</p>

<p>Hari-kiri&mdash;one form of suicide in Japan&mdash;is putting one's
self to death at the suggestion of the government, to save disgrace,
brought about by his own acts, and the scorn of his
countrymen. Disemboweling is generally the method of hari-kiri.
Self-destruction in this manner mitigates, to a large extent,
the disgrace that his family would otherwise bear.</p>

<p>Diamios are the landed class of Japan, and during the feudal
system of government they wielded much power with the
Mikado and the Shogun. Most of the stone lanterns seen about
the temple grounds are gifts from diamios. Samurai is the
term used for the army.</p>

<p>Women with blackened teeth are met with frequently in
Japan. As an even row of white molars often proves the means
of gaining the affections of a man, the green-eyed monster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
jealousy, in the Japanese husband prevents attention being paid
to his wife by another man by his making the teeth black. Yet
it is better for a woman to have her teeth blackened than to
have her eyes dug out, as is the custom in India. A husband
goes and comes when he so desires, as his liberty is not questioned
by his wife. Everything is in favor of the man in Japan; the
woman must breast an opposing current of inferiority almost
from the time of birth until death.</p>

<p>A saucy child is seldom met with in Japan, and it is a rare
thing to see a parent chastising one. Obedience of children&mdash;and
women also&mdash;is a national characteristic. Both Japanese
and Chinese children are the picture of health. The Japanese
woman is the model wife and mother.</p>

<p>After being invited to a home, and not seeing the hostess
about, would naturally seem very strange in most countries,
but this is a custom in Japan, lived up to in a great many
instances. Only in the homes of Japanese families where European
customs have supplanted native tradition does the hostess
and daughters take part in entertaining guests. Geisha girls
are engaged to entertain visitors, the host and hostess taking
a very small part in the entertaining. Guests, whether wearing
shoes, clogs, or sandals, leave these outside, as it is a universal
custom to enter a home or temple in bare or cloth-covered
feet.</p>

<p>In some Latin-American countries the customary salute, even
by men, is a hug, but in Japan it is a deliberate bow, then another,
still another, and the bowing does not cease until from
eight to ten of these salutes have been gone through. Judging
by the requirements in acknowledging pleasure at meeting a
friend, time would not seem to be at a premium in the land of
the Mikado.</p>

<p>The Japanese&mdash;whether high or low, rich or poor&mdash;are
very polite. Should any criticism be in order on this admirable
trait, it would be that the Japanese have a surfeit of politeness,
perhaps enough for themselves and their clever neighbors, the
Chinese. But it is better to have too much than not enough of
so good a thing. Meeting some countrymen away from home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
and at home also, the fact bluntly occurs that many Americans
are behind people of other nations in this attainment. As
the fronds of a wrecked cocoanut palm inspires hope in a greater
degree than any other factor we know of, so in like measure
politeness will smooth harsh feelings and contribute more largely
to real happiness in life than any other of our social requirements.</p>

<p>The island of Nippon is the largest of which the kingdom
is formed. The area of Japan is 150,000 square miles, and the
population about 50,000,000. The Mikado (Son of Heaven)
exercises monarchical powers, although the two legislative
bodies suggest the laws. Tokyo, with a population of 3,000,000,
has been the capital of the Empire since the resignation of
the late Shogun, in 1868. While Japan has made great strides
in maritime, naval and military affairs, and her schools, still
the home of the Japanese is not as good as the hut of the
Samoan.</p>

<p>Ninety miles above Tokyo is located Nikko, held in the same
degree of reverence by Japanese as the Hindus do Benares and
Mohammedans Mecca. Temples, mausoleums, mountains,
lakes, streams, and trees tend to make this an attractive place.
On leaving Tokyo for Nikko I had settled in a government
official's seat unknowingly. A trainman stood at the side, his
manners suggesting something had gone wrong. I asked him
if a mistake had been made, and just then the official stepped
between the seats and answered, in good English, "No mistake
whatever." He proved good company during the journey, and
when I had quit the first train to make connections for Nikko
he accompanied me to the other one and saw that I received
the best accommodation the train afforded. Not until I had
reached my destination had it occurred to me that I had occupied
his seat.</p>

<p>The lacquer merchants, damascene workers, and brass dealers
were all on hand, each extending invitations to give them a
call before leaving the city.</p>

<p>Aside from the natural attractiveness of Nikko, the first object
of interest that meets the eye is a bridge, 40 feet long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
spanning a river. This is arched in design, painted a bright red
color, but is not generally used for crossing the stream. It is
known as the Sacred Bridge, and was originally built in 638
B. C. Only Shoguns were privileged to use it, with the exception
of twice a year, when pilgrims to the shrines were allowed
to pass over. The original bridge was destroyed by a
flood in 1902, but the same reverence is maintained for the new
one. Only the imperial family is now allowed to tread the
sacred boards.</p>

<p>The gods of Japan range from dove-like images to demons
of the most savage type. A great many, much in evidence, have
been carved out of wood and are painted in flaring colors. The
god of thunder is a fierce-looking image, and monkeys and other
images are brought plainly to view with lavishness of bright-colored
varnish. The tomb of Iyeyasu, the great Shogun of
Japan, is located in Nikko. It rests on a stone base, with a
bronze base above, is cylindrical in form, and capped with a
bronze cover representing the design of a roof over some of the
shrines. Another tomb, nearly as famous, is that of the great
Shogun's grandson, Iemitsu. It is over 300 years since these
notables were laid to rest in that attractive section.</p>

<p>From some of the temples radiate a dazzling light when the
sun is shining, by reason of the rich gold-lacquering and the
wood carving being painted in flaring colors. Standing at the
base of a pine tree-covered hill, these temples are not imposing,
yet, by reason of no expense being spared in their embellishment,
they are conspicuous, and even famous. The greater
wealth, contained in the holy of holies section of the buildings,
a stranger does not see. The colors are so glaring and some of
the gods so fierce looking, that, while appreciating the great
expense in creating the structures and images, one would be
safe in regarding the scene as depicting a savage art.</p>

<p>While costly temples prove a magnet to both native and
foreigner, nature has been very liberal in dealing with Nikko.
The stately cryptomeria, or cedar, trees growing at the approach
of and in the temple grounds are admirable. An attractive
avenue of these trees embowers a highway passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
through Nikko for 20 miles, some of which rise to heights of
over a hundred feet, and are from two to nine feet in diameter.
Three hundred years ago these trees were laid out and planted
so close that, save for openings above the lower trunk, where
the trees begin to narrow, the space on each side of the roadway
is solidly walled by cedar bases. We have seen nothing to
compare, in uniformity and distance, with the two rows of
cryptomeria at and below Nikko. Pine and other trees grow
all about, and rivers, cascades, and inviting glens all go to make
the surroundings very attractive.</p>

<p>Soap must be furnished by guests in some hotels, and matches
as well. While in India travelers generally furnish their own
bedding and shoe polish, in our Nikko hotel all these accessories
were furnished, together with a bath kimono and mat sandals.</p>

<p>"Ahayo" is the word one will be greeted with when passing
a group of rosy-cheeked, slant-eyed, clothes-quilted, clog-shod
Japanese children. If the salute be returned a bow will be
made by the happy cherubs, when they will clatter on their
noisy way. "Ahayo" is "good day" in the English language.</p>

<p>All accounts must be settled before New Year's Day, when a
national settlement takes place, or the debtor will be dishonored.
If a creditor feels disposed to extend debts, the debtor is saved
from disgrace. The most precious thing in a home must be
sold to meet obligations at the close of the year. This custom
necessitates a great fair being held just before New Year's Day,
which occupies miles of space in the larger cities. Both high
and low visit these annual fairs, and purchases are liberal,
as every one knows the reason for which the articles are put on
sale. These fair districts are illuminated with electric lights
and native lanterns, and many indigent Japanese become shopkeepers
for the time being.</p>

<p>In some districts of Japan a funeral, when the deceased is
an aged or respected person, assumes the form of a festival.
Friends bring money, cakes, saké (native drink), plums, sugar,
edibles of all kinds, and flowers. All bow before the home
altar and assume a praying attitude with the hands. Then
the offerings are placed before the shrine. When all the sympathizers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
have gathered, bowed, and deposited their offerings, a
feast is prepared, which often continues for two days. The
Japanese have no fear of the hereafter, and this custom is maintained
to honor the respectable dead.</p>

<p>Nikko homes are similar to those seen in other sections of
Japan&mdash;small, one-story frame buildings, with paper-square
doors.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span></p>

<p>Returning to Tokyo, from that city we left for Yokohama,
where the fourth ship we had traveled on since leaving Manila
was making ready to start for Honolulu, 3,400 miles separating
the Japanese seaport from the Hawaiian capital.</p>

<p>Sailing from Japan on a Japanese ship, second-class was the
best accommodation we could afford, which did not mean anything
in the nature of luxurious living. The butter&mdash;well, it
was not the kind one gets on a farm, and seemed to be made of
at least three constituents&mdash;olive oil, peanut flour, and colored
lard. Twenty foreigners were on the ship, the other passengers
being Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos. A request was made
of the captain, who was a Britisher, to oil up the table, as it
were, when luxuries like catsup and pickles improved things
somewhat; but the Oriental butter remained true to its original
taste and color.</p>

<p>For the first two days out the ship sailed through the tail of
a typhoon, after which summery weather prevailed. A number
of Chinese sailors, with collapsible tables, appeared on the
deck below, where, in a half-circular space, on each side of
a dividing line, were printed the words, "High&mdash;Low."
On the tables were small teacups, a pair of dice alongside, and
small piles of money&mdash;silver, gold, bills, and nickel coins of
several countries. A half-dozen of these gaming tables did
business part of the day, and some all day. This form of
gambling is common on most ships sailing in that part of the
world.</p>

<p>Nine days out from Yokohama a green island hove in sight&mdash;one
of the Hawaiian group. The next morning the ship
lay to in a blue-water bay; shortly afterwards she was being
towed through a channel and was soon alongside a wharf at
Honolulu.</p>

<p>One would be led to think from the questioning, ticket examination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
passport identification, and other immigration regulations,
that the streets of Honolulu were glistening with diamonds
or other precious material. Immigration officials take
passengers' steamship tickets on their leaving a vessel, and travelers
regain them only when about to enter the gangplank on
leaving the islands. Thirty days is the longest period allowed
for a stop-over. Orientals, however, leave a ship by hundreds.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the Hawaiian Islands is its
climate&mdash;perpetual summer. Most of the white people seen
were Americans, but whites are much in the minority. The
street-car system is good, the cars modern, and some large and
roomy. No color line is drawn, and Asiatics are seen at every
turn. While Chinese and Japanese merchants control the
business in less prominent streets, American business houses
dominate the business center. Some of the stores are good, although
prices are higher than on the mainland, as the United
States is termed.</p>

<p>Ice and bananas were the cheapest things quoted, the former
selling at half a cent a pound and bananas at 5 cents a dozen.
Milk, on the other hand, costs from 10 to 12 cents a quart, and
butter was quoted at 40 cents a pound. Beef, mutton, pork and
veal sold at 22 to 26 cents a pound. Turkey and chicken, live
weight, sold at 35 to 40 cents a pound. Fresh eggs brought
from 50 to 75 cents a dozen. Potatoes are sold by the pound,
and cost 4 cents. At 60 pounds to the bushel, potatoes cost
$2.40. A 50-pound sack of good flour sells at $1.65 to $1.75.
Coal sells at $12 a ton, but little is used, as summer prevails
the year round. A cord of wood costs $14. Gas is $1.50 a
thousand feet, and electric light 17 cents a thousand watts. A
furnished room can be rented for $2 a week, however, and popular
priced restaurant food can be had for a dollar a day.
Street-car fare is 5 cents. House rent ranges in price from $20
a month upward. A house renting for $30 a month includes
ground containing cocoanut palms and other attractive tropical
growths. Wages paid are about the same as those on the
mainland. Street laborers, mainly Portuguese and Russians, are
very well paid, receiving from $1.60 to $2 a day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>The percentage of motor-cars to population is very high.
There are about 1,200 in Honolulu, and, as the population is
50,000, it works out an average of one motor-car to every 400
inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Don't Spit" signs, printed in big type, are posted in rooms
and at public places, suggesting that lung trouble is prevalent.
Honolulu is similar to Los Angeles, Cal., in this respect, as many
wealthy people with that malady make their home in this pleasant
climate, which may account in a measure for the many
motor-cars seen.</p>

<p>With the exception of some business buildings, the later-built
of these being attractive structures, Honolulu is built of wood.
The lumber comes from the Pacific Coast, and, as the price for
1,000 feet ranges from $37 upward, it is needless to add that it
costs a good sum to erect substantial buildings in the Hawaiian
Islands. A great many of the homes, however, like others in
warm climates, offer a very inviting appearance, as verandas are
built all around, and, if two or more stories in height, each floor
has a porch attached. Flowering vines grow over these, and in
the home space is often found the poinciana regia, a crimson-flowering
tree, as gorgeous in color as the flambeau growing in
Durban, South Africa. Cocoanut palms and bamboo also grow
within the grounds, while the streets may be studded with the
trunks and arched with the long fronds of a different specie of
attractive palm tree. Together with flowers, pineapples, banyan
and mango trees, one has a setting nearly as good as that
offered in the metropolis of Natal, between which and Honolulu
there is a marked similarity.</p>

<p>The temperature varies only about 30 degrees the year round.
During the summer the thermometer seldom rises higher than
90 degrees in the shade, and rarely drops below 50 degrees during
the winter. Wherever the cocoanut palms are seen growing,
one knows there will be no cold weather. While the sun
is hot during the day, one can sleep under bed clothing at night.
Nairobi, British-East Africa, and Entebbe, Uganda, were other
places visited where the nights were cool, though a hot sun
shone during the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>As in New Zealand, there are said to be no snakes nor poisonous
plants. Bees and yellow jackets, however, buzz about all
day. Mosquitos were unknown in the group before 1826, when
a Mexican whaling ship, it is said, started a "colony."</p>

<p>Sugar-cane growing is the most prosperous industry here, notwithstanding
that it requires more care, cultivation and expense
than in other countries. Irrigation and fertilization are necessary
to insure crops in some parts of the group. All the soil
is of volcanic origin.</p>

<p>The wages paid sugar plantation workers are from $18 to
$26 a month, with free house rent, cooking fuel, and medical
attendance. In addition to wages, a bonus is given to workers
who remain to the end of the season. The homes are built of
lumber, rest on posts from two to four feet above ground, and
are whitewashed. We believe many white persons in the United
States would quickly accept an offer of work at the wages paid,
comforts included.</p>

<p>Pineapple growing, which holds second place to the sugar industry,
is a new venture; and those familiar with the nature of
the soil, and the droughts, blights and pests that have to be combatted
have not full faith in the permanency of the pineapple
industry here. Corn would do well if a bug did not eat the
heart out of the stalk when young; cotton also, but for a pest;
fruit would be abundant if trees were not attacked by the
Mediterranean or some other fly, and cattle thrive as long as
feed and water are available; but, owing to frequent droughts,
animals die on some of the islands nearly every year; Irish potatoes
would yield a good crop if a bug did not eat the vines&mdash;in
short, pests are so numerous that the government has sent scientists
to many parts of the world to seek parasitic insects that will
destroy those which now devastate the crops. On some islands
where wells had been bored for watering the cattle, it turned
out so salty that the animals would not drink it.</p>

<p>The streets were full of "Thank you, ma'am." In some instances
one side of a street contained a walk and the other side
the Oriental form of sidewalk, native soil. One might walk
about Honolulu for a day without seeing more than three or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
four policemen. In such a mixed population, with bumpty-bump
streets the rule, and hop-step-and-jump sidewalks numerous,
it is safe to presume the city management might be improved
on. But a splendid municipal feature is the patrol
wagon. This "Black Maria" is an artistically painted, swift-geared,
smooth-running, attractively screened automobile. The
smart appearance of the "Maria" is enough to tempt poor people
to commit an offense against the law in order to get a ride
in the handsome machine.</p>

<p>No beggars were seen, which indicates there is little distress,
neither are there government almshouses. Refuges for old
people to end their days have been provided, however, maintained
by public-spirited citizens. In very few parts of the
world will one find as comfortable homes as those occupied by
the laboring class of Honolulu.</p>

<p>Save for music from the picking of strings of a guitar or
banjo and sounds of song coming from groups of Kanakas as
they pass along the streets in the evening, there is little native
life left. With few exceptions they wear European clothes, including
shoes. Like all natives living on the islands in the
Pacific Ocean, the Kanaka is not much given to work. When
an ambitious feeling does come over him he then wants to
work, but when these moods are absent he cannot be depended
on. Like the negro, there is little push in him, and it is said
that there is not one successful business Kanaka in the group.
Japanese and Chinese have taken advantage of openings that
Kanakas should have accepted. When there is an easy job in
sight, however, Kanakas want to secure it, a majority of territorial
positions being filled by natives. There is little
initiative in them, and one is safe in asserting that it requires two
to do one man's work. Withal, the Kanaka, like other tribes
of the Polynesian race, is a very agreeable, peaceable, good-hearted,
care-free person.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo444" id="illo444"></a>
<img src="images/illo444.jpg" width="550" height="341" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Panorama of Honolulu, Hawaii.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A few of the native customs are still maintained, notably wearing
garlands, and, by way of show, a grass skirt may be seen
worn by women. A garland of white flowers encircles the head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
and one of red, lavender, yellow, or other color is worn about the
neck. In front, under the neck garland, a clump of orange
leaves or some other growth is worn. Their hair is straight,
features regular, complexion swarthy, and they are of good
build. The mausoleums of the Kanaka kings rest in a cemetery
a short distance from Honolulu.</p>

<p>High, pretty hills rise behind the metropolis to the shore on
the other side, and the view of the city obtained from some of
these, stretching out at the base and beyond to the turquoise
blue sea, with light green fields of sugar-cane to the right extending
to Pearl Harbor, and Diamond Head to the left; beautiful
verdure and attractive homes in between, together with
the seductiveness of the balmy air and tropical growth, holds
one in Hawaii when better success might be achieved in a more
rugged clime.</p>

<p>Among the attractions of Honolulu is its aquarium. Some
of the beautifully colored fish swimming about the glass tanks
look more like pretty birds than fish. There is also a good
museum; a beach, where natives, standing on boards, disport
themselves while the breakers are rolling in; parks scattered
about the city, in one of which a native band plays every evening;
forts, which may be visited, located close to the city, and a trip
around Oahu Island is a very pleasant one.</p>

<p>I was offered work at good wages, but as the time at my disposal
could be better utilized in familiarizing myself with the
country, and having no desire to remain, energy was reserved
until the mainland was reached. Two English dailies, four
Japanese, one Chinese, and a semi-weekly Portuguese newspaper
are published in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The Hawaiian Islands were discovered by Captain James
Cook, the noted navigator, in 1778, who had planted the English
flag in Botany Bay, near Sydney, Australia, seven years
earlier, and who claimed Tasmania and New Zealand for England;
he also discovered the Tongan group. The Kanaka, true
to Polynesian custom, welcomed the captain and his crew on
their first visit. A year later, however, upon the return of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
skipper, he got in trouble with the natives, who killed him. A
monument is erected to the memory of the great navigator on
the Island of Hawaii.</p>

<p>David Kalakaua was the last of the native kings; he died in
San Francisco, Cal., in 1891, his sister, Liliuokalani, being proclaimed
Queen. Two years later, in 1893, the Queen was deposed,
when the islands virtually became an American possession.
In 1898 it became a territory of the United States, with Sanford
B. Dole as its first governor. What was once the royal palace
of the rulers of Hawaii is now the capital building. Liliuokalani
lived for years in Honolulu in a white-painted house,
built in beautiful grounds.</p>

<p>Eight islands compose the group, namely, Kauai, Niihau,
Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Hawaii, the latter,
from which the territory takes its name, having an area of
4,015 square miles; the other seven combined have not the area
of Hawaii, the eight totalling 6,449 square miles. Captain
James Cook first gave the name Sandwich Islands&mdash;now obsolete&mdash;to
the group.</p>

<p>Leaving Honolulu for Kilauea crater, soon we rounded Diamond
Head, and some time later Molokai, on which the territorial
leprosy colony is located, appeared on our left. A portion
of this island is utilized for stock grazing purposes, but the
grass was white from drought, and cattle were dying for want
of water. Maui was next reached, where what should have
proved a nice land view also was blighted by the drought. Later
we sailed alongside Hawaii, its vegetation offering a more inviting
scene than those left behind. A number of stops were
made during the journey, passengers leaving and others boarding
the vessel. Most of the white travelers were Americans. After
several landings in Hawaii, Hilo was reached, where all passengers
left the ship. Hilo, next in size to Honolulu, has a
population of 7,000, mostly of color. A large tonnage of
sugar is shipped from this port, where the harbor, the best in the
group, has been improved by a good breakwater.</p>

<p>From Hilo a start was made for Kilauea crater, which may be
reached by train or motor-car. The train was taken, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
proved even slower than the ones traveled on during the short
trips from Manila. Some excuse might be offered for the
Hilo train, as the route is up-grade, while the railways in Luzon
are as flat as a table. Finally the train "stuck" at a steep
grade, and the conductor, who was a Kanaka, did not know what
to do to get it started. He was "waiting for orders from
Hilo," he said. The train was later detached, however, and,
when the parts had been taken over the humpback and linked
together again, it crawled slowly through large sugar plantations,
past tree ferns, and other attractive landscape scenes, until
we reached Glenwood, the end of the railway line, where a mail
motor car was ready to take passengers to the hotel, nine miles
beyond. An elevation of 4,000 feet had been traveled from
Hilo to the object of our mission. Many passengers had wended
their way to this place, and it seemed odd, after having been in
black countries for three years, to find every one at the hotel
locking the door to his room at midday. In some countries
passed through the room doors were not closed even at night.</p>

<p>Looking down upon and over a depression in the earth, bastioned
by deep walls of rocks on each side, 7¾ miles in circumference
and containing an area of 4¼ square miles, there spreads
out for three miles a fissured, hillocked, corrugated, gnarled,
steam-emitting surface of slate-colored and black lava. This is
the first view one obtains of Kilauea crater. The scene is very
unusual, and interest is sharpened to a keen edge. Later a
journey is taken over that strange lava wake, when the leaven
from the fire-boiling underworld suggested the tremendous force
contained below the sphere on which man treads. We had
looked at the teeming volumes of water being ejected from geysers
in Yellowstone Park; but water washes away and will
eventually become purified as the stream it joins leaves the
geyser zone. But here the lake-like, deep, black earth deposit
remains, although, like the water from the geysers, for a time it
had been a moving stream also. An acre of land area with
similar deposit would attract scientists from great distances,
but here there are over four square miles of that subterranean
deposit. One obtains a side view, as it were, of a portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
world turned inside out by nature's force at Kilauea crater.
There was no soil, no rock, no trees&mdash;the substance under, before,
all about us was weirdly foreign to what is natural to the
upper crust of the earth and to the sky above. Further on the
fissures became wider, the hillocks higher, and the substance
warm. Still yet ahead steam&mdash;or white smoke&mdash;is issuing
from the cracks in the alien deposit, and when these are reached
canny, hissing, and gurgling sounds from underneath are heard.
From every side appears varied formations, molded while the
lava was changing from liquid to solid matter. Some of these
resemble mummies, great coils of rope, petrified trees, columns
of iron, and other shapes. Beyond appears a large volume of
smoke, reminding one of a great geyser basin on a calm, early
morning. Approaching, the air becomes sulphur-laden, a hand
is put to the nostrils, and natural breathing for the time is
withheld, to prevent one from choking from the netherworld
fumes. The wind now whirls the noxious odors away, and a
still further advance finds one on the rim of a deep, yawning
maw. Unearthly fumes again envelop the onlooker, but a
friendly breeze again wafts the poisonous vapor to other parts,
when the awful vent in Kilauea's deep, leaden crust reappears.
Boom! comes from below, and smoke envelops the gaping
chasm. A draught of wind sweeps the smoke from the pit
of the fiery abyss, and&mdash;&mdash;A black and red stream of fire
is seen swirling across the strange floor below! It is Halemaumau,
the greatest active volcano in the world, termed "the
safety valve of the Pacific." The volcano is about a thousand
feet in circumference, and the fire swirls several hundred
feet below the lava-crusted rim. How many persons have
had the rare privilege of looking into an active volcano? There
it was&mdash;Halemaumau, in Kilauea crater.</p>

<p>Locating to the windward of the volcano, the demon-like river
of fire was, for the time being, holding revelry in quiet volcano
fashion&mdash;but volcanic fashion. Boom! came from below, as if
from ordnance in action nearby, and fiery rocks were hurled
against the lava-scaled sides. Ah! A clear stream of liquid
fire now runs across the base as a river. Then sulphurous smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
envelops all. There (after the smoke has lifted) now runs
what seems like a river of thick, black dirt; but small explosions
are taking place. A red seam next shows through the volcanic
dross. A clear red river of fire&mdash;&mdash;Boom! The sides of the
crater, like icicles&mdash;flushed by the rays of a scarlet sun&mdash;on a
rock-faced coast, formed from a surging sea, are gorgeous with
dripping lava. Were a black panel implanted across a morning
aurora&mdash;that is how Halemaumau's strange river looks now.
The current runs but one way and comes from the same side of
the fomenting maw. Where does the lava stream come from?
Into what outlet does it empty? Boom! Boom! The burning
depths seem to rise on a platform of fire. Listen to the
splash as the red, upheaved rocks fall back into the furious maelstrom!
What a pretty, clear stream of carmine liquid! It has
passed away, and the black, dross-like course has again taken the
red flow's place.</p>

<p>There was no afterglow in the west, and the shades of evening
were soon enveloped in the scroll of night. See Halemaumau
now! How grand in the darkness! All about is flaming red.
There is the same unspecked fiery river, flowing in the same
direction as before. Half black now, and half red, but coming
from the same invisible source and becoming lost in the invisible
outlet. A clear, red stream again, but appearing further away.
The liquid fire seems to have been sucked far below! An abnormal
expansion of the axis on which the world revolves takes
place. Boom! Boom! Boom! The tremendous force from
contraction ejects flaming substance from the nether-world high
up against the sides, and from Halemaumau's flare the sky above
is aglow&mdash;an esplanade of fire spanning the space between the
infernal abyss and the vault of heaven!</p>

<p class="p2">The last stop has been reached on the long journey. From
Honolulu, after visiting Kilauea crater, I continued to San Francisco
on an American ship, the fifth vessel traveled on since leaving
Manila. After a stay of several weeks in San Francisco, in
order to earn a portion of the money necessary to secure railway
passage to New York, and borrowing $50, a start was made for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
the Atlantic seaboard, stopping off a week at Washington, D. C.
New York was reached May 1, 1913, having left
Gotham nearly three years and three months earlier.</p>

<p>In order to point out how cheaply one may travel, if economy
be practiced, this statement is offered: From the time of leaving
New York, February 9, 1910, until my return to New York,
May 1, 1913, I had been away 1,176 days. I had for the
journey $1,350. My earnings in South Africa amounted to
$2,400, in San Francisco $60, in Washington, D. C., $15, which,
with the $50 borrowed, makes a total of $3,875 for the entire
time consumed by the tour. By dividing $3,875 by the number
of days&mdash;1,176&mdash;an average expense for everything of about
$3.30 a day is the result. The distance traveled was 73,689
miles, and the itinerary and accompanying map indicate the
course from place to place. No wrecks or accidents were encountered&mdash;no
such experience having taken place in all my
journeyings. I have often thought I traveled under a lucky star.
